            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is mans nature, or his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, in the turn of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to run commonly toward extreams; for while he ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles to get out of the clutches of an error on one hand, the very force of his own ſtriving, with a little trip of Sathan, letting him looſe upon the ſudden, throws him quite down upon the other. We have very ſad experience hereof in our times, which makes the day of Reformation, between the animoſities and exceſſes of two parties, and the mouth of Separation, to be <hi>as if a man did fly from a Lion, and a Bear met him, then going into a houſe, and leaning againſt a wall, a Serpent bites him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great unhappineſſe of our dawning Government, next to the laying the ground of our diviſions in her own bowels, has been the entruſting her pious deſigns to the managemen of over-eager ſpirits, who finding no other hold-faſt on the hearts of Godly men, havr preſsed too hard on a Tryal to the Sacramen
<pb facs="tcp:119920:3"/>as if they built alone on this foundation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the divine right of Church-Government ſtands firm on its own baſis, as diſciplin is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from worſhip. Indeed it is a pious office of thoſe the Holy Ghoſt has made overſeers, to look into the ſtate of their flocks, according to pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and conveniency, and if they take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion at this Sacrament to do part of that office (if they have opportunity) upon theſe grounds, who can gainſay them? And indeed had men held forth in this tryal only a chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and paſtoral duty, the people would be willing to lay burthen enough on us; but when a power muſt be eſtahliſh'd, cloathed with a divine right, and that urged with the terror and danger of cenſure, and damnation: No wonder if tender Chriſtians, fearing a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage bringing upon them, riſe up for their precious Liberty; for Chriſtian conſcience, which is the ſeat and tributary only of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God, abhors to become a ſervant of men, and while it trembles at every word of holy Scripture, as ready to be turned with a twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thread, will never be brought to bow, ſtoop, or abate a jot, to all the powers in the World.</p>
            <p>A certain Governour of the <hi>Jews</hi> having ſet up Trophees, covered with Armour and ſuch Ornaments, in honour to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the people were all in a mutiny, as at an indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to their Religion; upon this he calling the
<pb facs="tcp:119920:3"/>chief of them together, points to the Trophees, asking, what they thought they were, they began to exclaim, Images; He ſeeing their zeal, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their coverings to be taken off, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath they were stocks of wood; The <hi>Jews</hi> ſeeing that, were preſently turned, and all their fury huſht into a ſubmiſsion. I humbly judge thus of our Reformation, if ſhe will ſet up her Examination, under ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, as pretend Divinity, we ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of it as an Idol, but if ſhe would take off the Armour and dreadfulneſſe of it, and let it appear but an humane Ordinance for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there are few, happily, but might bear with, or ſubmit to it. <hi>If thou be kind to this people, and ſpeak good words to them, and but pleaſe them</hi> in this Free Admiſsion, <hi>they will be thy Servants for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do acknowledge the ſpirits of many the moſt holy Chriſtians, have their faces ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a mixt communion, and I do humbly reverence the many pantings-and breathings of their hearts, after a fellowſhip of the Saints on Earth, as neer as may be to the Church in Heaven, which will ever cauſe it to be no otherwiſe with us, ſo long as any zeal in mens affections ſhall prevail over their judgements; Yet do I tenderly believe, that Chriſts example enclines not their way. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no argument ſinks ſo deep in
<pb facs="tcp:119920:4"/>my heart, as to ſee the winding of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, againſt which I have Chriſts own life alone as ſatisfactory. My Saviour Chriſt was holier than them all, he was the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt man, and the ſweeteſt and humbleſt man that ever breath'd; He never ſayes to any of us, <hi>Depart from me, I am holier than thou,</hi> unleſſe at Judgement; He never ſpake ſuch a word, I warrant you, in all his life. The most holy, and the moſt <hi>lowly,</hi> the moſt <hi>ſeparate from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and yet <hi>a friend of ſinners.</hi> Truly methinks the conſideration of this gracious temper of Chriſt in that meekneſſe of his, and acceſſableneſſe to poor ſinners, enters moſt nearly into the embraces of my ſoul, and claſpings about him, when I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelf moſt undeſerving all his benefits; Nay, if I may confeſſe my very heart (for ſuch an untoward thing it is) I do more ſenſibly (according to thoſe poor, ſmall, wretched affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions I have) love him more for his ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, amidſt the doubts of my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than in my beſt aſſurances (they are ſo fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) for his dying in particular for my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. We never read of any he turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but if they will come quite home to him in ſpirit, they ſhall be welcom to all his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; If they will come but to a profeſsion, he has even ſome love for them alſo, <hi>Mar. 10.21.</hi> they ſhall not be grudged the benefits of that
<pb facs="tcp:119920:4"/>profeſsion, <hi>Whoſoever comes unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that doctrine that has ſo fair a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from the holy Jeſus, that goes the way of humility, and tends to peace, which if it may be Religiouſly embrac'd, would have kept us from, and might end our diviſions, and yet do no more harm unto the main, than to forward it, is not unworthy more willing contemplations. There are ſome have thought the World was made by a concurſe of Atomes, I think, if ever the multiform opinions of men, which like thoſe Atomes, fly up and down, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Church Government, do concurre in one, they muſt have their confluence and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation at this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved of ſome diſeaſes, that the fear of having them does bring them; we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it here in pious men; the fear of Church-levelling, has leveld us; their own Tenents have ſerved to do it; the frights of our Mother, brings her travel upon her.</p>
            <p>There are four principles amongſt us, <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, Presbytery, Independency, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtianiſm.</hi> Some are for <hi>Martin,</hi> and ſome are for <hi>Luther;</hi> But is Chriſt divided? Might not one Jeſus ſerve all parties? We know the perfect temperament of natural bodies is of the four Elements; and it may be in our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the prime qualities of either of theſe were well diſputed and allayed, they might
<pb facs="tcp:119920:5"/>unite, and educe a form of the richeſt extract for our mixt Churches.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Herod,</hi> to his great renown, promiſed the people, to re-edifie the Temple, and was beginning upon it; they came and beſought him by all means to forbear, till he had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the materials, and could aſſure them he was able to build it a new, before they pluckt down the old; which when he had taken ſome three years time (if I forget not) to do, then they joyfully went about it, and accompliſhed it. I humbly Imagin, this would have been good policy among us, that <hi>the Houſe</hi> of our Reformation, <hi>while it was building, had been made ready before it was brought thither, that there might not have been heard the noyſe of the Hammer and the Ax,</hi> in any of theſe claſhings, while it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
            <p>As for the Presbytery, I verily believe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of zeal, and fear of the Lord breathes as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently in moſt of them, as in any of the Saints on this ſide Heaven. I heartily wiſh <hi>their moderation were known unto all men,</hi> as their piety; though I doubt not too, but ſome very precious of them gather with us, whilſt others ſcatter abroad; ſome cannot but ſee, and feel, and pity our perplexities. The Lord knows truly what it is that makes the hearts of <hi>many ſad that ſhould not be ſad,</hi> and ſtrengthens the hands of our ſeparations.
<pb facs="tcp:119920:5"/>For my part otherwiſe, I could be contented to lye in the duſt, for I am nothing, and can let the world know, while Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> calls Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> one of the number of <hi>Core,</hi> a <hi>Kain,</hi> a Deceiver, a boaſter, ſo monſtrouſly proud, that he even takes the judgment ſeat to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; I thank the Lord, if I may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg my preſent temper, that Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> thinks Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> a very zealous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Jeſus Chriſt; and I do adviſe the Reader that the harſhneſſe of his paſsion may not prejudice his cauſe, but that he will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth whereſoever he finds it, pitying his weakneſs, eſpecially in theſe four particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe the Sacrament is not to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred without the Church, unto Heathen, to convert them to the faith, therefore it cannot tend within the Church to any unregenerate Members ediſication.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe that Infants, Diſtracted, and Excommunicated perſons are not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, therefore there is the ſame reaſon for all ignorant and ſcandalous perſons; The often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of this, is a dead fly in his Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> His manifold unſavory catchings at my words only and expreſsions, which is purſuing my ſhadow, and not ſatisfying my Conſcience, as <hi>p. 15.</hi> to <hi>21.</hi> eſpecially <hi>p. 92, 93, 94.</hi> which is too unworthy a tender Chriſtian.</p>

O my Saviour! though he get no good in the making, let me receive good in their healing, let me have one drop of thy blood poured into thoſe wounds, and how ſweetly will it heal them! let me find Oylin my good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> while I fall amongſt them, and thy balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> under the reproach of <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one paſſage I may not omit in his Preſace, <hi>When I weigh his looſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with his being ſo favourable to the looſer ſort, it makes me and other to ſuſpect his practices, &amp;c.</hi> For my Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I hold thus; It is the duty of all Church-members of age to frequent the Sacrament; A man muſt examine himſelf and ſo Eat, he muſt come, and come worthily; If he be not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, that will not excuſe him from his duty, he must do both, as in other Ordinances, and there is no eſcape otherwiſe. Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> holds, If a man be not worthy he muſt abſtain, and that is his duty. Let the righteous judge, if this take effect, which will prove the looſer do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

<pb facs="tcp:119920:6"/>I, that I ſhould judge my Brother?</hi> Good man! he is here afraid to ſin againſt God in the judging of me he knows not; but ſhould he know me in all the ſecrets of my heart, and whole life, from my youth up, Alas! he does not think of me half ſo bad as I do; I am verily, &amp; in my own eys, much worſe than he dare judge of me (to wit, in his ſober, not raſh, indgement.) I heartily beſeech him to ſpend as many prayers unto God to make me better in his ſight, as he has done words to make me vile unto the World; and that while he <hi>ſays unto my Soul, Bow down that I may go over, I may lay my body as the ground, and as the ſtreets, and let him go over.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as there are ſome of theſe, who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and godly, may be diſpleaſed, for which I am ſorry; there are others, with whom my Book, or ſubject of it, has found acceptance. I find <hi>4.</hi> ſorts of them.</p>
            <p>The firſt, are a humble lowly ſort, that love to ſerve God, and be quiet; that follow their ſtudies and devotions in a ſtill voice, and make no more noiſe of Religion, than a ſigh can do, and the ſoft droppings of a tear; Theſe can meet no body, but they are ready to bleſſe God for them, as ſeeing ſomething in them, that makes them <hi>eſteem them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than themſelves;</hi> They can think every one penitent, when they come to the Sacrament, as they are themſelves. When Zeal is ready to
<pb facs="tcp:119920:7"/>ſay, I only am left alone, Humility thinks, there are ſeven thouſand beſides me. Theſe are <hi>Nathaniels,</hi> true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, in whom there is no guile; I bleſſe God for a taſt of ſome ſuch ſpirits, whoſe ſweet encouragements herein, have as it were <hi>brought water to the thirſty, and prevented with their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, him that fled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort, are moſt of the old way, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which, there may be indeed, too many of the looſer ſort, whom nevertheleſſe we muſt not exaſperate, but meekly admoniſh to repentance, and be contented, with <hi>Rebeccah,</hi> when we <hi>open the well</hi> for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, not to let <hi>the Man drink only, but the Camels alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third, are part of the moſt judicious, of free and unprejudiced ſpirits; who judge the main body of my Work neceſſary, though ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Authors weakneſſe, and are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>As the Shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the Lion two leggs, and a piece of an ear,</hi> to reſcue ſome parts of it, ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, as uſefull, and fit for better Meditations: Even as amongſt thoſe Votaries, that were met withall by <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and about to be put to death, <hi>there were found certain of them, ſaying, Slay us not, for we have treaſures; ſo they forbare, and ſlew them not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt ſort, to whom I owe moſt,
<pb facs="tcp:119920:7"/>are many unſatisfyed doubtfull Chriſtians, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through tenderneſſe of conſcience, or ſearch of underſtanding, while the former, poor ſouls! look in their hearts, and find ſome good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but not a prevalency of reſolution in them; while they feel ſinne, and a love unto their ſin, and yet a hatred of that love; while they have ſome ſigns of grace, and want others, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they ſo greedily embrace the Sacrament as a means to beget that in them, they are in doubt of, or elſe must come upon their certain ruine. I muſt confeſſe it is a notion has enter'd my heart, and runs through this Book; Let the poor ſinner come, as condemning himſelf, and apply Jeſus Chriſt in the ſenſe of his condition; Let him come with a rope about his neck, for our King is a merciful King. <hi>If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.31.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the latter, the wiſe and more piercing, as they may not be ſo ſtrict in their apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ſolemnity, they do mainly enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of grace; how the Spirit works it, by way of moral Swaſion only, or Infuſion, and that at once, or by gradual preparation; they know not whether ſpecial grace differs from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon any otherwiſe, than the ſame ſeed caſt in divers grounds, in regard of root and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and conceive this Ordinance with others, to be means and helps for the rooting of it, or for the begetting thoſe farther degrees, which
<pb facs="tcp:119920:8"/>make that grace, that before was not, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſaving, and ſo they can allow a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable latitude in their admiſsion. It was the famous Tyranny of one <hi>Procruſtes</hi> towards ſtrangers, to lay them in his own bed, and if they were ſhorter, to ſtretch them out to the length of it if longer, to cut them ſhort to his Stature. I heartily bewail the extream rigor of too many of thoſe we hold Orthodox, that would have all other judgments cut even with the model of their own, eſpecially in theſe firſt effectual workings of Gods Spirit, which are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to reaſon, various in experience, and unſearchable; as to the way and means whereof, <hi>Jo. 3.8.</hi> there is none may limit him. <hi>For the Bed is ſhorter than that a man can ſtretch himſelf on it, and the coverings nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower than that a man can wrap himſelf in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, There are two kind of Readers into whoſe hands my lines will come, my bare Readers, or my Iudges. For my bare Readers, I do heartily fore-warn you, not to truſt to my judgment, but to ſtay and ſee what others will write of it, counting of me only as one that have propoſed your minds, that you may be ſatisfied. In the mean while, I beſeech you Brethren, in the Bowels of Chriſt, be ſubmiſsive to your Paſtors, and grieve not the more knowing and pious ſouls of thoſe, that ſo indulgently watch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you. For my Judges, I only wiſh them to
<pb facs="tcp:119920:8"/>be moderate, unprejudiced ſpirits, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, and I ſhall ſubmit unto their cenſures. If I have <hi>built Wood, Hay, or Stubble, on Chriſt the foundation, let my work be burnt, but my ſelf ſaved;</hi> I ſacrifice it to the flame, where it ſhall dye, though Truths malefactor, yet a Martyr, as to the innocency of my intentions, and to teſtifie my repentance, turn to aſhes.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a poor Book of mine got into the Preſs, about the Sacrament, little in its bulk, leſſe perhaps in its worth, and leaſt in its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. It hath pleaſed one of a Reverend title, to take ſo much notice of it, as to vouchſafe me a confutation. I humbly think my ſelf to be engaged to him for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, though his language is unacceptable, and grievous to my ſpirit. I muſt confeſſe it is not ſatisfactory to my judgement, yet muſt I thank him for his good will at leaſt, and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intentions. I perceive ſome of my friends are ready to look on his work only as a piece of ſpite, and product of paſſion, and have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me to return him my ſilence, as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to fit him. But when I ſeriouſly look into my own thoughts, I find not my ſelf ſo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119920:10"/>ſlightly affected; and to ſpeak freely, ſeeing I know him not, I rather judge it to be out of zeal, though overborn indeed too much with ſome diſtemper, that makes him ſo hot and deſperate in his Exceptions. He is afraid that the temper of my Book, which is free and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is ſo ſuited to the ſpirits of honeſt people, that it will draw them after my opinion, which he judges to be dangerous, and may do hurt to them, and therefore labours (in his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to deface in it, whatſoever has but the appearance of humility, or ingenuity. A man may be more froward many times, than wiſe. As for the many revilings then, wherewith he ſo often bleſſes me, in the ſcatterings of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, I profeſſe they move not me ſo much (though they grieve me too bad other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) in regard of the diſgrace, for I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it, as they they do pleaſe me in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
1. That this zealous man, I count, is ſo much the more in my deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which I deſire him to pay for me at the throne of Grace. And2. That if I ſhould be in any error, (which the more I doubt, the leſſe I know) here is ſome ſalve for it, to heal it in others, and expiate in me. For this cenſure, I truſt in the kindneſſe of my Saviour, ſhall be all the puniſhment he will lay upon me for my failings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and while I receive my evill things here, I ſhall hope for my good things to come, where my reproaches ſhall be turned into a reward, and <hi>the Book my Adverſary has wrote against me, be bound to my ſhoulder, and made a crown to me,</hi> by being ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified of God for a furtherance to his mercy.</p>
               <p>When I read Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> at firſt, of all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119920:10"/>it was that Text, <hi>Ez.</hi> 13.22. that went to my heart: Methinks I could almoſt wiſh I had never been, rather than do any hurt to the Church of God; and it were better a mill-ſtone were about the neck of my Book, than that it ſhould offend any of Chriſts little ones; for though I were thrown into the Sea, thy mercies, O Lord, is even there alſo! This made me look the narrower within my own breaſt, to ſee what token the Lord would ſhew me for good: Methinks I alwayes ſee much infidelity ſwimming over my heart, which may give ſome riſe, and ſecret occaſion of my over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pity to ſuch perplexities I perceive in many about the Sacrament, when others can rejoyce to ſee their pious tears, and lay more ſtrictneſſe on it; I do ever ſuſpect the worſt by my ſelf: Now while in my addreſſes unto the mercies of God, and all thoſe billows of my ſoul that beat me to this ſhore, I found nothing lay ſo deep at the bottom of my heart, which kept me in ſome weeks ſuſpence, as the making my account hereof at the great day; I bleſſe the Lord for ſome refreſhings amidſt my ſorrows, perſwading me, that there is ſome true fear of God in my inward parts, though <hi>evil be preſent with me, Ro.</hi> 7.21. which I think once wrought in me <hi>in the days of my youth,</hi> if I <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> right <hi>the love of my eſpouſals, when I was going after him in a Land not ſowen,</hi> but ſince have been ſtraying in <hi>a wilderneſs</hi> of ſin, wherein I were loſt without his mercy.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119920:11"/>the good or hurt of mens precious ſouls, than the regard of my name, let my honour lie in the duſt, and my ſoul in aſhes; Let my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be conformable to my ſin, for it is great, O Lord, even where I ſee it not, and may be greater, in being hid from mine eyes till o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers find it: for as for thoſe many paſſages, wherein I am accuſed of pride, and cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Thou knoweſt my conſcience is ready to acquit me, yet will I not acquit my conſcience, which may take part with my ſinful nature, but deſire thy mercy to clenſe me, and it, from all my ſecret, as known corruptions.</p>
               <p>For the making my Apology, or defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Oppoſer, I ſhall humbly crave the liberty he has taken, not to trouble my ſelf too much about it.

But it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119920:11"/>is much ſadder to lie under fears, we ſhould not fear, and have <hi>the bones broken,</hi> that ſhould not be broken. I have ſeen the teares of friends, I know the difficulties of ſome ſpirits, and my own ſcruples, and I do fear, there is no ſoul deeply tender, and doubtfull of his condition, can ever ſolidly have peace at this Sacrament, unleſſe it be allowed a means of Grace to examining Chriſtians, that find as yet they ſavingly want it. <hi>They came to the pits, and found no water, they return with the veſſels empty, and were aſhamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I begin with Mr. <hi>Drake,</hi> it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to conſider in the way, how he is pleaſed to judge and deal with me, as if my whole book were only in oppoſition unto them, whom it leaſt thought of in many parts of it. Thoſe whom it orderly concerns, are,
1. All ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſtians in general aggrieved about this Ordinance.2 In particular, the more ſcrupulous, that wholly neglect to adminiſter or receive, only for want of diſcipline; which I take, is <hi>doing evil that good may come of it, whoſe diſallowance is just.</hi>3. Weak Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, made ſo by others ſtrictneſs, that judge the Sacrament defiled to them, if they eat with any but the Godly; I have ſeen ſome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hereof, I pity.4. The more heady zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Chriſtians, that cannot be quiet without ſeparation.5. Then in the laſt place, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any forms to be ſet up as <hi>neceſſary</hi> to our worſhip, which is but <hi>arbitrary</hi> and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential, leſt it bring a burthen on ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, which like the poor, willing, humble Camel are even ſtooping on their knees to take
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119920:12"/>upon them. Now a right diſtribution only of my Book, in the ſeveral paſſages to theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons and comportments, will turn the body of it ſo aſide to the blows of my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, that the moſt part of them may paſs by empty, and do it no harm. <hi>For thou Lord, art a ſtrength to the poor, a ſtrength to the needy in his diſtreſs, a refuge from the ſtorm, a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow from the heat, when the blaſt of this terrible one is but as a ſtorm againſt the wall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to come towards the work; In the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Mr. <hi>Drake</hi>'s Book, I meet with a cenſure; I am ſorry to ſee it. I will not ſay it is a piece of childiſhneſs or incontinency, in a man of his title, nor that it is a mark of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in the forehead of it; but I do think that while he is ſo forward to be <hi>known among the Elders in the Gate,</hi> the more humble of his brethren are ſo aſhamed for him, that they may afford him <hi>Scarlet</hi> in their bluſhes. I could have wiſht him firſt to have ſpent a few leaves in a due <hi>examen,</hi> that a conviction might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before his ſuſpenſion, which might have cooled him a little perhaps; even as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were wont to bind up their inſtruments of puniſhment into bundels, which they called their <hi>Faſces,</hi> that the wrath and paſſion of the Magiſtrate (before whom in honour they were carried) might be aſſwaged ſomething in their giving judgment, while the <hi>Lictors</hi> were unbinding them.</p>
               <p>After the Frontiſpeece, to omit the Preface, he begins his four firſt pages with a quarrel at the Title of my Book, <hi>An humble Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. and then produces four paſſages <hi>for the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119920:12"/>World to judge of them, whether they ſavour not of pride, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I am content, let the World judge, and think upon Chriſt; It is no wonder he cannot find in his heart to afford my Book its due Title, that is a going about to crucifie it. However, if any pious men are offended at me. I think it ſafeſt to crave their pardon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing in the preſence of God, that there was not one of theſe paſſages that came from me to my utmoſt memory, with the leaſt bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion upon any, but were the meer harmleſs daughters of invention; nevertheleſs, if the Mother be froward, the Child muſt do ſo no more.</p>
               <p>And now I appeal to every godly heart; to take off from me, as to their aſſent, this raſh <hi>Cenſure,</hi> ſeeing there is none can be judge or witneſs herein, but God and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, who as to theſe particulars do clear me; yet though I know nothing by my ſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but my own fears, am I not juſtified, for there are many others may condemn me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flying to his mercy. If my heart had not warmth, or zeal enough for ſome paſſages, nor eſtabliſhment for others, nor worth enough to ſuffer ſome things in my Prefacer. Forgive, O Lord, the iniquity of thy ſervant, who is more aſhamed of his ſinne, than to confeſs his ſhame, which none eyes ſee, but thine. And let not theſe ſcruples of my weak ſoul come in deriſion, but let me be contented yet to become more vile, while all applauſe of men, and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, fall down at thy feet, and give up the ghoſt unto thy glory.</p>

Pray ſee at leiſure; and as for thoſe Texts of <hi>Io.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Io.</hi> 13.10. he compares with the paſſages at this Supper, I ſhall ſay as <hi>Ioſeph, It is not in me, God ſhall give an anſwer</hi> to theſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119920:14"/>texts <hi>in peace.</hi> In the firſt, Chriſt tells them, <hi>Iudas</hi> was a devil, yet ſayes he, I have choſen him. In the other, he ſays, All of them were not clean; he ſpake it of <hi>Iudas,</hi> yet he waſhes his feet. So here he tels them he will betray him, yet communicates with them: See how ſweetly my adverſary makes for us. So gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious is the temper Jeſus Chriſt, he refuſes none ſo far as they come into him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, or in profeſſion.</p>
               <p>And thus having anſwered Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> five reaſons, which, <hi>p.</hi> 5. he tels us <hi>ſeem to him very weighty and convincing;</hi> Now you ſhall have Mr. <hi>D.</hi> himſelf anſwer them, <hi>p.</hi> 97. Iudas <hi>being</hi>
1. <hi>An Eminent Profeſſor,</hi>2. <hi>A very knowing perſon,</hi>3. <hi>Not legally convinced of ſcandal, I do not ſee how he could be denied the Sacrament.</hi> If he ſee no reaſon why he ſhould be denied it, his firſt reaſon then, <hi>Chriſt knew him to be a Hipocrite,</hi> (depending only on this ground, that he might not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted becauſe ſuch) is no reaſon; and his other four no reaſons; but in effect he does as good as tel us thus. There are reaſons indeed brought to prove that <hi>Judas</hi> received not the Sacrament, but for his part he can ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in them.</p>
               <p>Pag. 7. He reckons up many Authors (quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Gelaſpi</hi>) for this opinion; to which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, as the Philoſopher being perſwaded to believe in the God <hi>Neptune,</hi> by one ſhewing him thoſe many votive tablets were hung up to him in memorial of thoſe that had eſcaped Ship-wrack, anſwered, but where are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of all thoſe that were drowned? So ſay
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119920:14"/>I, the Reverend <hi>Gelaspi</hi> reckons up here theſe Authors that were of opinion, <hi>Iudas</hi> received not the Sacrament, but what are theſe to all them, that were of opinion he did receive it? I reverence Mr. <hi>Gelaspi,</hi> I reſpect Mr <hi>Drake,</hi> I much more reverence thoſe many Authors, but I do not value them at the rate of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> or that one text, <hi>They all drank of it.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>All</hi> he ſays, <hi>p. ibid. is put for all preſent, and twelve for eleven, quoting for it</hi> 1 Cor. 15.5. <hi>where it is ſaid, he was ſeen of all the twelve, by Roundneſs of number.</hi>

1. Iudas <hi>might be preſent, and yet not receive, but this he Won't ſtand upon.</hi> Alas! what pity tis, which would ſtand him in ſo much ſtead and he cann't make it good,2. He is very peremptory, that S. Luke <hi>Writes per <gap reason="foreign">

Although the Scripture ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times puts a whole ſtory after another, which in order of time was before it, yet where ſhall we find ſuch an Hyſterologie, as takes a peice of a former ſtory, and joyns it to another, as a part of it, to which if it be taken to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, it becomes a manifeſt falſhood? we will not abate one jot or tittle of the truth of St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel.</p>
               <p>P. 9. <hi>But ſuppoſe Iudas was preſent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> 1. <hi>The Apostles ſcarce ever ſuspected him, though diſcovered.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> What then? It is manifeſt by this, that Chriſt and his Diſciples did not judge it neceſſary, to look into <hi>Iudas,</hi> to find out whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he lived in any known ſin. They examine themſelves, and ſay, Is it I? Now how will Mr. <hi>Dake</hi>'s trial, that is a means <hi>to vex hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> (as he words it) <hi>by prying into others, and uncaſing them,</hi> p. 49. &amp; 117. be ſutable to this humble temper of the Diſciples, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Chriſt?</p>

It is abſurd to ſuſpend any for a future ſin, and yet he ſuſpends all, to prevent the ſinne they have not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Nay, this ſuppoſal only of a future ſinne, is the very ground of his Excommunication, when he debars them nothing but actual recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in any ordinance.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I am ſorry to ſee, that prejudice, and intereſt of opinion, ſhould ever raiſe men to this high degree of imagination, That it was not fit for Jeſus Chriſt, the great Maſter of Diſcipline, to take ſo much power over his Diſciples, as the Presbytery over their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: This is a ſad paſſage, to ſee what a fluce this man has opened to let in the ſtreams of contempt come in upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is far otherwiſe with us, ſeeing none are ſuspended, but</hi> 1. <hi>ſuch as ſuſpend themſelves, by refuſing due trial.</hi>

If I ſhould do ſo, ſeeing I am call'd to ſpeak my conſcience, I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119920:16"/>ſhould fear it were a ſin. Alas Sir! Will you not let men ſerve God, and ſave their Souls?</p>

If they come wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and you find them unfit, and ſo ſuſpend them; then you go about to puniſh them again for a future ſin. The truth is, if you are really ſo tender in this buſines, you may repair to your people in that humble way of admoniſhing them with tears, and from houſe to houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20. I ſay not you are bound to this, <hi>de jure,</hi> that you neceſſarily ſin elſe; but <hi>de facto,</hi> I think it might be done with more profit (if that be all you intend) and good will, as unto them. I would rather allow you twenty El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to watch over, and inſtruct men for the Sacrament, than two only to turn away any from it.</p>
               <p>P. 10. He argues <hi>Contra; None of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were ignorant or ſcandalous; therefore</hi> Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das <hi>and their receiving cannot warrant any ſuch others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is not true; for indeed we ſhall find both ignorance in the Apoſtles, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal in <hi>Judas.</hi> Here <hi>the Lion and the Calf are down together, and a little Child may lead them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the diſciples ignorance, it is manifeſt; The true ſaving knowledge of remiſſion of ſin, lies in Chriſts reſurrection, <hi>Ro.</hi> 4.25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. but they were ſo wholly ignorant even of this grand point, that they knew not the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119920:16"/>Scripture that he muſt riſe again, <hi>Io.</hi> 20.9. Nay, what think you, if they underſtood not the point of his death neither? Judge impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, what knowledge could they have, at, and of this ordinance, if they conceiv'd him not as crucified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26? Now I pray compare <hi>Mark</hi> 9.31.32. <hi>Lu.</hi> 9.44.45. with <hi>Lu.</hi> 24.7, 8. and it is ſaid plainly, <hi>They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not the things Chriſt taught them about his death, and remembred them not till he was riſen.</hi> Adde hereunto, we find no mention of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or forewarning of Chriſt, before the inſtitution; ſo that whatſoever they did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of the nature and uſe hereof, it was only what the preſent words did afford them. From whence we may reſolve, that though people are but little knowing even in ſome fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, and have but a rude implicit faith (I mean the word orthodoxly) and good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, they may be admitted to this Supper; and I think moreover, that our preparation Sermons, and preſent Exhortations (which ſhould be about the main) with our prayers and ſolemnity, may clear our own ſouls in this pattern of Chriſt, as to the ſufficiency of their inſtruction, for edification; though where prudence directs to more, if without bondage, I humbly commend it.</p>

                  </gap>nd you find it apparent, that <hi>Iudas</hi> made his bargain with the high Prieſts about betraying Chriſt, two nights before the Paſſeover, ſo that, that line of his where he ſayes, Judas <hi>had not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed Christ, any more than</hi> Peter <hi>had denyed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119920:17"/>him,</hi> is a very untruth; And as for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or divulging of it, Chriſt himſelf did (I think more than once) reveal it. But now, if there had been any Examination requiſite, as Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> pretends, about their viſible worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſearch whether any of them liv'd in a known ſin, would not Chriſt have been as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in doing his Miniſterial duty, as this Man? Could not he have ſent but two of his diſciples unto the Prieſts to find him out, and witneſſe againſt him, and might not <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> (who call themſelves ſo) ſerve for Elders? And I pray now, is it viſible worthineſs upon trial, or viſible memberſhip, that Chriſt went by in his admiſſion? You may even pity the lamentable caſe he here has brought himſelf, that he has nothing to help it, but confeſs, <hi>Tis true,</hi> Judas <hi>had betrayed Chriſt in purpoſe, and compact already, but Chriſt charges him not with that, but foresels his actual treachery;</hi> that is, <hi>Iudas</hi> indeed was actually a ſcandalous perſon, but Chriſt did not charge it on him as as bar to his admiſſion. He did not, that were enough, therefore it is not neceſſary. Yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I pray take notice of the words in <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.24. <hi>Lu.</hi> 22.22. and they are ſpoken in the preſent tenſe, we muſt not yield a jot of the truth and purport of Chriſts words, when Chriſt ſayes, <hi>One of you ſhall betray me,</hi> and <hi>Verily the Son of man is betrayed,</hi> they are both true and about the ſame treachery; <hi>Shall,</hi> as to the apprehenſion, and <hi>Is</hi> betrayed, as to his fact paſt in his agreement, which is ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (while Chriſt will yield to it) to be in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect done. What is here wanting now, but an
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119920:17"/>opening this, and proceeding againſt him? and yet in the very nick he leaves it, Is not our cauſe plain? Beſides, what man will not judge, that <hi>Iudas</hi> treaſon (which Chriſt tels them of) conſiſted in his contrivance, bargain, taking money, and ſelling Chriſt, as actually, as his comming with the Officers into the garden? So that it will be in vain to ſtrive againſt the truth: If Chriſts example herein be a ſufficient rule for our walking, we muſt be content, and willingly embrace the humble peaceable way of Free-admiſſion.</p>
               <p>P. 11. He only repeats the queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Judas</hi> ought to be ſuſpended? (for as for St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he wrongs him much, to joyn him with <hi>Iudas,</hi> ones ſinne being by deſign, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready on foot; the others, un-imagined before, and meerly out of preſent infirmity,) and he anſwers, No.
1. <hi>Becauſe his ſinne was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Anſ.</hi> I ſay that is not true, unleſſe <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> ſelling Chriſt, be no ſin with him.2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Christ could not be both witneſſe, Iudge, and Executioner, &amp;c.</hi> which we had before, and again more fully, p. 90. <hi>Christ as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had no juridical power, to turn him, or any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, &amp;c.</hi> Nor any, it is bravely ſpoken; you may read forwards, and the ſum is this; The Lord Ieſus could not turn away <hi>Iudas</hi> from the Sacrament, becauſe the Presbytery was not ſetled. <hi>Selah!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that at the great day ſhall be Iudge and Party, and tels us <hi>Io. Though I bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my ſelf, my witneſſe is true,</hi> that is, is both Witneſſe and Party, may, I hope, be both Iudge and Witneſſe, without abſurdity.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:119920:18"/>
               <p>As for the queſtion, Whether he acted as a Miniſter, or Mediator? it is vain; for he acted as both. He could not inſtitute an Ordinance for his Church, but as he was Head and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, nor could he adminiſter it, but as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; the ſame numerical actions were both the inſtitution, and the adminiſtration. So that, let us but look theſe paſſages full in the face, and fix wiſtly on them, they are quite out of countenance, and I ſhall need no more to put this man to a mild rebuke, than the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words of our Saviour Chriſt; <hi>The ſervant is not above his Maſter, nor the diſciple above his Lord; It is enough, that the ſervant be as his Maſter, and the diſciple as his Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Chriſts temporal refuſing to condemn the Adultereſſe, it is impertinent as to this his Eccleſiaſtical command, inſtitution, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And for his adminiſtring only <hi>to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in an upper room,</hi> it proves we may ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters; too, if need be; as his admitting <hi>Iudas,</hi> proves we may admit of our Chruch-members; but if he argues <hi>therefore we muſt do no otherwiſe,</hi> here is a clear negative from an affirmative, which is no conſequence.</p>
               <p>Whereas therfore he tels us in the iſſue, <hi>State the caſe aright,</hi> (when he plainly ſtates it wrong as to <hi>Iudas</hi> fact) <hi>Mr.</hi> Humphreys <hi>has made a wide and wild inference, and intreats him to take a more pertinent Text, or elſe he ſhall ſcarce prove himſelf, as he is ſtiled, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Arts.</hi> I do appeal to mens hearts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as they are inclinable to <hi>Iudas</hi> receiving, they find them not generally, ſtanding or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to this Free-admiſſion. I ſhall quote

                     <hi>That in the Church God hath ſet up his Ordinances, of the Word, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Of theſe Ordinances ſome are capable, and ſome uncapable; Thoſe that are uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are either ſo by nature, (as Infants, and diſtracted perſons) or the Excommunicate, and no others, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Before I paſſe, for the fuller opening this, I muſt deſire you to conſider theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay <hi>Within the Church,</hi> in oppoſition to Heathen, becauſe it is Church-memberſhip (limited only with this capacity) I hold, that give; our right to this Ordinance, as other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119920:19"/>outward privileges. The Sacraments may be conſidered <hi>Preciſe,</hi> preciſely in themſelves, and it is Church-memberſhip, I ſay, or an external Covenant relation, that ſuffices to the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof; or <hi>Complexè,</hi> complexly, with the intire fruits and benefits of the Covenant, and ſo indeed there is no leſſe than a juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith required for the obtaining of them. Our queſtion, truly, is not concerning what is neceſſary in order to other ends to the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that he may be ſaved, (ſo final perſeverance is neceſſary) but what is neceſſarily antecedent to the external Sacrament. And between theſe two, A Covenant relation viſible, and truth of Grace, which is inviſible, there is no middle thing in the Scripture enjoyn'd for the rule of our admiſſion. A viſible member of the Church, and a member of the viſible Church are but the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I explain <hi>thoſe that are uncapable</hi> in the firſt ſenſe, in ſaying, <hi>by nature,</hi> and, <hi>that can diſcern no meaning hereof;</hi> (as I have added) which I do cleerly to diſtinguiſh, Infants, the diſtracted, and natural fools, from the barely ignorant of age, who are capable to learn, and having the preſent means of knowledge, if it be not ſufficient herein for their edifying, it is meerly their own fault, and upon their own account. And there are two plain reaſons for the diſtinguiſhing of theſe, as to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, wherein the body of the Lord is to be diſcerned; Firſt, Becauſe this very diſcerning cannot be the duty of the former, who are <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi> uncapable, it being an undeniable rule thus far, <hi>Nemo tenetur ad impoſſibile.</hi> And
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119920:19"/>Secondly, Becauſe ſignes cannot work upon the un-intelligent (which they wholly are) to receive any <hi>Real</hi> effect by them. It is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the latter; for, 1. It is their duty both to get knowledge, and to come. 2. They have an underſtanding capacity, that they may be wronght upon by it, and if they be not, it is their ſin. Theſe reaſons I may tell Mr. <hi>Drake,</hi> are ſo ordinary and ſolid, that they will be as two gravel ſtones in the teeth of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, while he champs upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the uncapable in the ſecond ſenſe, (which word is not ſo proper here, but you may excuſe it) The Excomminicate, I do humbly allow two ſorts of them; <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> or <hi>De facto.</hi> The Excommunicate <hi>de facto,</hi> are ſuch who are both convicted, and have le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally ſentence paſſed on them. The Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> I count, All ſuch, though not juridically ſentenc'd, whoſe crimes are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, notoriouſly offenſive, and actual, ſo that there needs no proceeding <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> while the conviction is manifeſt, and they can plead no repentance. If you will not allow me my terms, I pray abate none of my ſenſe, and I care not. Such was the unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Coſby,</hi> perſons ſtark ſtaring drunk, as he mentions; Such are Inceſtuous Marriages; Thoſe that come newly reaking out of open enormities; Such I think are any that ſhall publickly renounce Chriſt, or ſay they won't believe in him; And it may be thoſe, who being in not orious malice, will not forgive, but profeſſe their obſtinacy. Upon this account only, I am apt to take it, Our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119920:20"/>Church hath held ſuch might be kept back by the Miniſter, when he ſaw it fit in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to do good by it; that is, if the ſhame were like to move them to repentance, ſatisfie the godly, and be a good example unto others. Otherwiſe I do not hold the Miniſter or Church is always bound to take cognizance hereof, for what has been ſhewn already ſo plainly in the pattern of Chriſt, And this I ſpeak,
1. To intimate a difference between thoſe that are <hi>excommunicable</hi> upon trial, which the un-convict may be; and the <hi>ipſo jute excommunicate,</hi> that are convict, not ſentenced. For ſo long as the caſe is dubitable, &amp; needs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,
1. We are to encline on charities ſide.2. We cannot act in faith to turn them away.3. To ſay you do not deny their right (<hi>de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> as members,) yet <hi>de facto</hi> ſuſpend them, ſeems to me a wrong, and a flaw to be made up.2. To ſhew my ſelf reducible at the leaſt beck of the Church, ſo long as ſhe forbears to ſet up <hi>her threſholds with Gods threſholds, and her posts with Gods posts.</hi> And here I muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of my oppoſer, Was not theſe words (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe excommunicate <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> or <hi>de facto</hi>) <hi>p.</hi> 24. in all three Editions? and why then does he ſo overly and contemptibly bring an <hi>odium</hi> on me, by being willing not to ſee, or underſtand them? Truly this is a very wrong; for while he takes things ſtill in the worſt interpretation, he uſes my book like another <hi>Hanun, He cuts off the half of the beard, and its carments in the middle. ſo ſends away</hi> the poor thing <hi>bare, and greatly aſhamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>For thoſe that are capable, I conſider this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119920:20"/>capacity in regard of the Church or Miniſters Admiſſion, and this I undertake, or in regard of the receivers own comming, which is more queſtionable.</q> In fine, the ſum and ſcope of my opinion came to this; As for the Receivers part, I durſt not be too forward to determine; Let every man look well what he has to do; But as to the Church or Miniſter, I held, and do hold, that all Church-members that are neither Unintelligent, or Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, ought freely to be admitted to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; Some caſes in ſpiritual, and temporal prudence, being conſidered.</p>
               <p>Againſt this poſition of mine, he has ſome 5. exceptions, which I will note, and anſwer in their order.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>That Infants and the diſtracted, as deaf perſons, are to come unto the Word, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not uncapable of the Ordinances, p.</hi> 13, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> For the deaf he ſpeaks miraculouſly well. For Infants, without queſtion, it were better they were kept at home, than to diſturb the Church, but only for the ſake of them that tend them. His texts <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are good to prove their convenanting by their Parents in baptiſm, where there is only a paſſive recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the benefits relative; but as to the ordinance of hearing, it muſt be actual, and they are uncapable of any Real work by it. So that for converſion (if he was out of his charm) which is of unwilling to be made willing, in ſuch a paſſive ſenſe of his, (ſpeaking of it, Really, not Relatively) as to be wrought on the untelligible, I think himſelf will diſlike,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119920:21"/>when he hath better thought of it. For the diſtracted, if he will needs have them come too, I would wiſh him to Preach over his book to them; but to take heed of tender conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, leſt it make them ſo. And now whereas <hi>he doubts not, but the judicious will eaſily reach him,</hi> it is very likely the height of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding herein, may be taken, without a <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> ſtaff.</p>
               <p>His ſecond is, <hi>That Infants and the diſtracted are as capable of the Sacrament, as the ignorant are, though of age.</hi> We will take this in his own terms. <hi>Next for the Lords Supper, I ask Mr.</hi> Humphreys, <hi>why are Infants capable of Baptiſm, and not of the Lords Supper? If he ſay becauſe they cannot examine themſelves, nor diſcern the Lords body, &amp;c. Then I anſwer, No more can groſly ignorant perſons, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Sir, you muſt excuſe me, I ſhall not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you altogether ſo, but
1. Becauſe Infants are naturally uncapable: In Baptiſm there is required onely a paſſive, but in the Supper an actual reception.2. Becauſe it is not their duty to examine themſelves, and diſcern the Lords body; Let members of age be never ſo groſſy ignorant (&amp; not Ideots) they are bound to get knowledge, examine themſelves, and be fit for receiving, and ſo come worthily, though not unworthily; but Infants are not bound to be fit for receiving, to know, diſcern, or ſo to come at all. And this I dare ſay is ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as will put him quite out.3. Becauſe ſigns cannot work really upon the un-intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; Relative grace is convey'd to Infants, <hi>ſuo modo</hi> by Baptiſm, but Real grace cannot be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119920:21"/>wrought by any Ordinance, upon thoſe that can diſcern no meaning of them, which yet is here, as at the word, prayer, &amp;c. required of us, that it ſhould be wrought and acted in us. I would have ſome men know, the <hi>Corinths</hi> ſin of <hi>not diſcerning the Lords body,</hi> was more of careleſſeneſſe or profaneneſſe, than bare igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. There is as much difference between Infants and Ignorants, as between a Do not, and a Cannot; If the one does not, yet they ought; but the other cannot, and are excuſed; Ignorants may not, but Infants cannot be wrought on by it. If the man had not been too ſlighting of me, he would never have run himſelf into the contempt of ſo many repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Infant-paſſage. I will reckon them as I goe. Here is once.</p>
               <p>His third Exception (waving what is in the way to its place) is againſt theſe words, 'And no others. <hi>If none others</hi> (ſays he) <hi>muſt be kept away, what thinks he of perſons infected with the plague, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Truly I think M. <hi>Drake</hi> might have been more ſerious, and that it may be I have been happy to leave out ſuch impertinencies, that he might have ſomething to put in. Who knows not if men be in a journy, or ſick, they keep from the Church on a civil account? with the like. Thus does his ſilver become droſſe, his wine mixt with water, and inſtead of an <hi>Amphora (currente rotâ)</hi> you have an earthen pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>For his other inſtances I am willing to grant (as I have but now expreſſ'd my ſelf) where there are ſcandals,
1. Notorious, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119920:22"/>the Congregation,2. So open, that they need no proof or debate,3. In the preſent fact, ſo that no repentance can be pleaded, ſuch may be dealt withall, as <hi>ipſo jure</hi> Excommunicate. If you ſhall demand of me a ſubſtantial proof, for yielding thus much, I muſt anſwer you, the Church is <hi>of age, ask it.</hi> What ſhe in prudence hath allowed, I am ready to think, there may be good reaſon for, though I know it not; We are to make the faireſt conſtruction, and it may be, ſhe would hereby teach her Children to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; revere, and dread the ground or cauſe of Excommunication, no leſſe than the cenſure of it. Yet if any here ſhall make uſe of this confeſſion of mine to the tenderneſſe of others, ſo poorly as Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> does of the un-intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, to plead againſt me only what I yield to them, as it will be an argument of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo ſhall it fortifie me with one proviſo more, which Chriſts example does afford, that, though I grant that ſuch as theſe (thus ſtrictly ſet down) may be kept off for the preſent, yet are we to chuſe to do that ſtill, in Chriſtian prudence, which is like to tend moſt to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties reformation, the peoples good, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God.</p>
               <p>His fourth is upon theſe words of mine, <q>
                     <hi>If any come in as profeſſing, &amp;c. p.</hi>
                  </q> 16, 17, 18. Here he overreaches the word, <hi>As;</hi> I ſay not All that come do make me profeſſion, I think there is no neceſſity of it, much leſſe, that the Miniſter is to ſeek after <hi>an Evidence of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi> which were a burden to break his heart; but I ſay, Every one that comes in, comes as a profeſſor, His very comming is <hi>a profeſſion of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119920:22"/>his covenanting with Christ.</hi> Even as the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers repairing to his Colours is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging his Captain, and Office: So is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to Chriſts Enſignes, our profeſſion of him, the pledge whereof is the Sacrament. For his appeal to my ſelf then, I anſwer, I ſtand not on a verbal, but a vital profeſſion, and this is either Real, the ſearch whereof I leave only to God; or Viſible, and ſuch is their comming. Church-memberſhip (without this incapacity) is all the evidence we can look after. To ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any Heathens into Church-memberſhip, requires their declaration or confeſſion, but as for Church-members, I ſay this is their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to wait on their duty.</p>
               <p>I do acknowledge a profeſſion, and a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed profeſſion, (our Church was wont to ſecure this by the Creed, which I think were good ſtill to be uſed) yet dare I not ſay any other way of that ſignification is abſolutely neceſſary, than this comming only; for I deſire to know where in the Goſpel, after initiation into the Church, there is any other ſignification of mens being Profeſſors, than their bare meeting, or aſſembling themſelves together at the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? So that if pious ſober men ſhall yet think it neceſſary to preſſe ſome trial, and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the faith of their Congregations to them, it can be urged, only upon the account of laying a ground for Reformation, and then, for ought I ſee, they muſt begin at Church-memberſhip, and not at the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>For Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> own undertaking, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, <hi>Let the people but maks their profeſſion before the Elderſhip, and we ſhall undertake to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119920:23"/>fit them for the-Sacrament, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 58. and there he addes unto this, <hi>In a few months, our end being the preparation of all ſorts, we dare undertake to fit the meaneſt.</hi> Now I pray com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this, with his language of me, <hi>p.</hi> 92. where I having ſaid, I endeavour this only, <hi>Doth he not know</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that one fit or worthy, muſt be,</hi>
1. <hi>Converted,</hi>2. <hi>Unblameable,</hi>3. <hi>Actually prepared?</hi> Lay this together, and you ſhall ſee the feats of this man, that will regenerate you a Congreation, make them unblameable, and actually prepare them <hi>(of all ſorts)</hi> within a few months: At leaſt he will warrant you, <hi>before he has done with them, if they will but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be ruleà by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His laſt exception is at my doubtfulneſſe on the part of the Receivers, <hi>p.</hi> 16. His words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are too Maſterly, but the difficulty is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. I perceive in his judgement he makes this no queſtion, but that while a man finds himſelf unregenerat, he muſt keep away, though he has examin'd himſelf and prepared for it. I dare not run down this ſtream with him. Our rule is this, <hi>let a man</hi> (not onely, let the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man) <hi>examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat,</hi> (not, ſo let him abſtain.) Some interpret the words <hi>Ita probet, ut abſtineat;</hi> Let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, that if he be not worthy, he muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; Others, <hi>it a probet, ut etiam edat,</hi> Let him examine, but ſo alſo that he eat. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the laſt; my ground is this, If a thing be evil, becauſe it is done, it muſt be avoyded; but if it be not evil in the ſubſtance of the thing, (as no precept can be) but for the defects of the Doer, the thing ſtill muſt be done, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119920:23"/>reformed. If to avoid this, Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> ſay, this is not his duty, I pray God forgive me, or forgive him, for I think it a grievous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, to make void a command of God, through his tradition.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">

                  </label> ANd here I might keep cloſe, but I will open my ſoul, for it is melted like water, which I am ready to pour out before the feet of Jeſus Chriſt, or any of his ſervants that will gather it up. I find the temper of moſt tender Chriſtians, when they ſearch their hearts for an habitual preparation required to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they reſolve into doubts about their comming: For while our Divines do as it were ſtrive to lay down the moſt ſearching marks of theſe graces, and our poor frail hearts cannot reach up to them, which the more ſtrict we judge uſually, the more ſpirituall, they begin to fail us, and if we go on, we are ever convinc'd of the want of them, and ſo doubt of our unworthineſſe.</p>
               <p>Now if we muſt hold the Sacrament to be a means of grace only to the Regenerate, and that none may come without theſe Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal graces, or thus habitually prepared, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approach to this holy Table, but the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Lord muſt fall upon us, as trembling to be guilty of the blood of Chriſt, and eat our damnation. O ſir! It may be the Lord has cleared your intereſt, that you can lay the hand of your faith upon Chriſts ſhoulder, and ſay he is mine; and in the confidence of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Gilead</hi> is mine. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is mine, <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:119920:24"/>is mine, this mark is mine, and that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence mine, here is my new name, and here the white ſtone. And now you may think it eaſie to anſwer theſe difficulties, not knowing the fears and doubts of others, when they cannot lay to heart the commoneſt ſigns, as Univerſal obedience, and Pure love of God, but inſtead of obedience, they find univerſal corruption, and inſtead of living only to Gods glory, in the beſt of their actions. they ſuſpect hypocriſie; So that they never hope to ſee the face of one Sacrament more in peace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they may come to Jeſus Chriſt, as wholly unworthy of him. <hi>Thou haſt ordained peace, thou hast don all our works in us and for us.</hi> O my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour! thou knoweſt this is an argument not fetcht from mere invention; this is an argument is ſown in mens tears, and it is fetch'd from the ſighes and bleedings of many thouſands <hi>that are made ſad, that ſhould not be ſad,</hi> whilſt they have received their wounds!, in the houſe of their friends. Alas! let us but ſeriouſly conſider, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muſt put this buſines over with a ſlight Examination, and connive at our failings, being ready to preſume theſe graces are in us, becauſe we dare not open our eyes to look fully upon them; and if we do thus, we ſhall bring ſecurity upon our ſelves, and the blood of our own ſouls; or we muſt deal impartially, &amp; conclude againſt our ſelves, we have not theſe evidences, if then we come unqualified, the blood of Chriſt will be upon us. Nay if a man ſhould be regenerate, yet doubts, and judges himſelf unregenerate, ſo long as he hold there is none may come hither but the regenerate, <hi>He that doubts of his eating,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119920:24"/>is damn'd if he eat.</hi> So that there is nothing left for poor doubting Chriſtians, but an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting gulph to ſwallow them up. And are any of us Miniſters, that are not in a capacity to abſtain from this Ordinance, what will become of us? The Lord knows, how few of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are truly regenerate; and ſhall we think every one that is not, muſt neceſſarily become guilty of <hi>the murder of Chriſt,</hi> (as he uſes that term) and eat his own judgement? What a ſad apprehenſion, what fears, and afflictions, muſt this bring on our ſpirits, whileſt we do but as it were gather our poor people, to receive their damnation. Good Gods! What a deal of blood ſhall we bring on our own ſouls? Who can lie under that terrible guilt that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily brought on us, by this dreadfull opinion? Neither have we any way here to ſtand up for our lives, and the lives of our flocks, but to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Ordinance, as well as others, a means of regeneration, to examining Chriſtians. For my part, ſhould I believe otherwiſe, I ſhould ſet my face againſt my Congregation, and bid them take heed, Here be theſe marks; and theſe upon them; and theſe upon them upon thoſe; Cannot you find them in you? Beware, touch not a crumb, upon pain of your lives; Come you not hither, there is ſcarce a man of you but will be ſure to be damn'd. Now let this but effectually enter into their hearts, and we ſhall leave the Sacrament, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did the Woman, alone with Jeſus Chriſt, and while every one is conſcious of his own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, we muſt even go out moſt of us, one by one, and be contented to have
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119920:25"/>our names written in the duſt.</p>
               <p>For ſome eaſe then of thoſe perplexities, I ſhall humbly venture to look over that text of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. from the 17. verſe to the end, which I think is the ground of them. And in the delivery of my thoughts, I beſeech the Lord to guide me by his grace, that I may do no hurt, nor offend any; and I adviſe my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not to truſt to my judgement, <hi>for I have no might to go out</hi> againſt theſe difficulties, <hi>I know not what to do, but mine eyes are upon him.</hi> Now there are 7 or 8 things, unto which I have a little to ſay, upon this Scripture.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, concerning the ſcope or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, which is open. The Apoſtle is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them, among other vices, about their diſorder at the Sacrament, which, while they mingled with their Love-feaſts, they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be drunken ſome of them, as at an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. Upon this he tels them of the Sacred inſtitution, the ſinne, and danger of ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and rectifies them in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is, concerning ſuch high expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which we find not lightly in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And there are two grounds, I conceive, in preſſing certain precepts, ſometimes above others. Either the Eminency of the duty, or defects of the doers. For the former, I would not have men think St. <hi>Paul</hi> advances this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, which he ſpeaks but lowly of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. above others, as Prayer, the one being only <hi>inſtituted,</hi> the other <hi>natural</hi> worſhip. But the latter is manifeſt; Here is a Church-ſin, that ſin is making that common, which was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, the uſing this Sacrament but as their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119920:25"/>Love-feaſts, which were not divine, and this profanation brought down temporal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on them. Their carriage was ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that it makes him ſpeak ſo deeply of this ſin, and danger thereof, to reclame them from it, attempering his language to his occaſion. For I am perſwaded, if he had been to write this Epiſtle to many of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as to <hi>Corinth,</hi> he would not have ſet it down ſo dreadfully, but rather fore-warn'd us of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
               <p>The third is, Concerning the nature of this Sacrament, and that we find clearly to be a Memorial of Chriſts death, or the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made by it, which we acknowledge, and ſhew forth in our receiving. Here may be two notes,
1. Whereas the Apoſtle undertakes to deliver down to us whatſoever he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord; There are many poor ſouls may diſcharge themſelves of ſome trouble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the notions of ſealing, and the like, when they ſink too deep into them.2. Whereas a Remembrance is of ſomething only that is paſt; It is a queſtion (I am not aſſertive) how the Sacrament is a token of the Covenant, any more than as to that moſt free, abſolute, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral act of Grace, in Gods ſo loving the world, that he gave his Son for a Covenant, Jo. 3.16. <hi>This cup is the New Teſtament in my blood,</hi> or that there is a new Covenant made in my blood. So that on Gods part, it may be A teſtimony of Grace, in this univerſal act or grant thereof; and on Mans part, a Note of his profeſſion, that he believes this, and looks for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119920:26"/>ſalvation only in his name. Neither in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the nature of the Sacrament open, need we abate any thing from the holy improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing is, What is this <hi>Eating and drinking unworthily?</hi> which phraſe <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf opens in another I will ſpeak next of. I ſhall now diſtinguiſh between a Worthy Receiver, and Receiving worthily. A worthy Receiver I ſhall account him only, that is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually qualifyed with the Sacramental gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or finds the condition of the Covenant actually in him: A receiving worthily, lies mainly I think in comming with reverence; This reverence I will conceive both in regard of the dignity of the inſtitution, and due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our ſelves, that we make our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe to it according to the ſtate of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>To open my ſelf, I will ſuppoſe (though what I laſt ſpake may put it to a quaere) as others do, that the Sacrament is a ſeal of the Covenant, even in application to ſingle perſons. Now then there muſt be two things, or parts of it ſealed, ſalvation to him that truly beleeves and repents, and damnation to him that does not. <hi>Promiſſio</hi> (ſays <hi>Calvin</hi>) <hi>non minuùs ir a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> incredulis minetur, quam gratiam fidelibus offert. Mar.</hi> 16.16. Now if a man finds true faith &amp; repentance in himſelf, he receives worthily, in applying the benefits promiſed to him. But if a man finds not his regeneration, and that he does not ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent of his ſins, he is then to come in the fear of God, applying to himſelf that part of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119920:26"/>the Covenant that belongs to him, being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to lay to heart his ſad eſtate, and certainty of damnation, without a true and total ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto Chriſt, who only is offered to him on that condition. In the application of the right part of the Covenant to a mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eſtate, lies the very eſſence of that convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Spirit works in us at our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>The fifth thing is, What is the meaning of that phraſe <hi>Not diſcerning the Lords body;</hi> and it is the not putting a difference between this ſacred, and a common table. I pray mark it, <hi>v.</hi> 29. and it is plainly exegetical of the former, as if he ſhould ſay, by their eating and drinking unworthily, I mean this prophane regardleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theirs, that they have no more reſpect to this Bread and Wine, than their ordinary meals.</p>
               <p>And this is farther clear by that illative <hi>Wherefore, v.</hi> 27. while the Apoſtle argues from the end of receiving, which is <hi>to ſhew forth Chriſts death,</hi> againſt their receiving unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, without conſideration of that end. He enquires not into the eſtate of the perſon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regenerate or not, but looks to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of receiving, becauſe they came not to the Sacrament as a memorial of Chriſt, as a ſacred thing, and holy inſtitution. If the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of either of the phraſes were to come without faith or regeneration (as ſome too harſhly preſſe it) then the <hi>Corinths,</hi> that were puniſht for this ſinne, muſt have been not only chaſtened, but condemned with the World, which they were not. <hi>v.</hi> 32.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119920:27"/>direct ſin then of this place, is their irreverence, and monſtrous prophaneneſſe, which I am perſwaded ought not to be laid to the charge of every unregenerate Chriſtian, if he comes humbly hither, in the ſight of his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The ſixt thing is, The import of that ſaying, <hi>He ſhall he guilty of the body and blood of Christ;</hi> &amp; it is no more than if he ſhould ſay, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe holy ſigns ſo regardleſſely, you offer an indignity to the things ſignified; As you commit a crime againſt your Prince, in defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Arms, or Royal Statue, wherein, there is a latitude conſiderable in the ſin, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the more or leſſe evill uſage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and I do not approve the drawing out theſe words, to that harſher language of <hi>Murthering Chriſt,</hi> or the like, ſeeing there is a vaſt difference between being guilty of Chriſts blood in the unworthy Receiver, and thoſe expreſſions of crucifying the Lord of Life, and trampling under foot the blood of the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh thing is, What is that duty, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf?</hi> Some read it, Let a man approve himſelf, and take it as to theſe particulars only in reforming them. I have been apt to think, Let a man examine himſelf; and ſo eat, is as if he ſhould ſay, Let him ſo eat, as conſidering with himſelf his own eſtate, and purport of this Ordinance, in ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meditations, and applications of it. But I willingly lie down unto the labours of our Divines, who generally make this ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be a ſearching into our hearts, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119920:27"/>our eſtates; about our ſins, in looking over the Commandements, to repent of them; and about our graces, in looking over our evidences, that we come with an habitual and actual preparation. Only I muſt lay down three cautions.
1. Take heed of ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding too much upon this, if you find it in you. When you come as one worthy, you may chalenge the benefits of the Covenant, upon bringing the condition; but if you do ſo, look well to that condition, for if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to <hi>Caeſar</hi> you muſt go; there are ſome might have been ſaved, if they had not appealed to their condition.2 If you find not theſe graces, and are grieved in the want of them, let not that ſtave you off from Chriſt; But humble your ſelf, reſolve againſt ſin, and think I ſhall be ſo much the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to my Saviour, not only for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, but alſo for my condition. Though it be faith only can receive any thing from Chriſt, yet is the ſenſe of our unworthineſſe, a proper qualification to bring us to him, both to receive that faith, and the benefits of it.3. If thou findeſt thy ſelf wicked, and living in ſin, thou art to repent, and mayſt defer thy coming upon reſolution to prepare againſt next Sacrament; But if thou thinkeſt to go on in thy courſe, and ſo forbeareſt, I tell thee (as I judge) thou muſt come, and apply to thy ſoul, that part of the Covenant that is properly thine. Thou art to eat, and ſay with thy ſelf, As this bread and Wine holds forth Chriſt and his benefits only upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo it ſhews what I ſhall loſe, and as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119920:28"/>ſure as I eat and drink I ſhall be certainly damn'd, unleſſe I repent, and leave theſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for here is the ſeal unto the truth of Gods word, and I yield unto it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>All the people ſhall ſay, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt thing is, What is this <hi>Eating and Drinking damnation?</hi> and it is the incurring, either with ſome, a preſent temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (and ſo the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſenſe too, <hi>v.</hi> 32.) or, with others, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, deſert, or guiſt of eternal. Both which, nevertheleſſe, a due judging our ſelves, through Gods mercy may prevent, <hi>v.</hi> 31. And here I muſt give you two diſtinctions, which you are to receive, as you intend to have peace in this thing.</p>
               <p>The former is, between a general, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular receiving damnation. In general, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſay certainly, Every unregenerate man receives his damnation as he reads, hears, prays, &amp; works his damnation in every thing he does, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. which things nevertheleſſe muſt be done. The meaning is, I take it, that nothing he does, or can do comes up to the condition of the Covenant, but there is ſome failing and ſin, which muſt be accounted for at the great day, and ſo it is ſaid to increaſe their damnation, though their account would be yet greater (we muſt conceive) if they ſhould not do theſe duties at all. But for this particular, <hi>Eating damnation,</hi> which is the effect of the unworthineſſe of this place, incurring a more peculiar, or deeper guilt upon a perſon, may not be charged, I think, upon any, but upon thoſe that come ſo irreverently, without reſpect
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119920:28"/>to this holy inſtitution, that they ſin in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fact, in uſing it as <hi>common thing,</hi> which ought not to be done. An unregenerate man may come Chriſtianly, though but in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conformity to this Ordinance, it is our duty; but he may not come preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly as to a common Table, and prophane it.</p>
               <p>The other diſtinction I muſt commend to tender ſpirits, is between Eating damnation, and Sealing damnation. The one is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of irreverent unworthineſſe provoking God; The other is only a confirming, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the truth of the Covenant to every man according to his condition, which is much for the honour, and owning of God. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks my heart is enlarged, and I muſt tell you, theſe two things muſt be ſeparated as far as Heaven and Hell; I wiſh there were ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance, that the plague of the one might never trouble you under the notio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the other, which has eat unto our very hearts, that I am afraid men won't receive this manifeſt truth. It is a moſt precious ſweet mercy of God when he denounces judgment upon an impenitent ſinner, to awaken his ſoul, and bring him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; It is the very like, or ſame gracious act of his, in ſealing to his word to ſet home that conviction, as it were uſing all means (as Chriſt did with <hi>Judas</hi>) to work upon him. Now it is likewiſe every mans duty (while God ſhews us the way, it muſt be ſo) that lives impenitently, to apply theſe threatnings, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſeal them upon himſelf, and ſo to take that part of the Covenant (as I expreſſe it)
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119920:29"/>that belongs to him. So that this thing, which has appeared ſo terrible to drive men from the Sacrament, that they do but ſeal or apply dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to themſelves, is the only thing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for them to do in this eſtate, as they ever look to be converted and ſaved. O that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſinful Chriſtian would but do this with due reverence, and a ſerious conſcience, and I would aſſure him this ſealing his damnation, is the only way to eat his ſalvation in the uſe hereof. If you ask here, But how then is Chriſt offer'd to ſuch a man? I anſwer, Very well, as truly as he is preached in his threatnings; Chriſt is never offer'd to any, but as wrapt up under the tenour of the Covenant, which contains both wrath, and life. In the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is neceſſarily ſhewn forth to the hypocrite what he ſhall loſe, unleſſe he will become ſincere, as to the ſound believer, what he ſhall have in the partaking of them. There is ſomething ſealed actually, and ſomething potentially to every man; Actually the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate hath life ſealed to him, but Potentially damnation, if he fall away from his faith; which though we beleeve he never ſhall, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods grace, yet as on his own part he is frail, this is a means to make him ſtand. An unregenerate man hath wrath actually ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, but potentially, all Chriſts benefits, which is as it were a voice behind him, that though he be in this preſent fearful eſtate, yet if he will but repent and believe, he may get out of it, and be ſaved. Thus do Judgement and Mercy interweave their forces to bring in a ſinner unto Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:119920:29"/>
               <p>And here may be removed that dreadfull ſcruple of ſome poor Chriſtians, who apprehend they have been unworthy, and there damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has then been ſealed, now the ſeal being ſure, how can what is ſealed ever be reverſed? I anſwer, <q>The alteration is made only in us, the Seal is the ſame, and what is ſealed is the ſame. A man walks in one place, and is in the ſhade, he turns into another, and is in the ſhine; yet the Sun is the ſame: The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſeals the Covenant, Man ſeals to his condition; while he walks not accordingly his damnation is ſealed, when he repents and does, his ſalvation; Actually and potentially both are ſealed, and according to his walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he hath the influence thereof, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the light of life, or ſhadow of death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is one Iron only enter'd my ſoul, and it was this: If the Sacrament be a Seal, it does exhibit and convey ſomething to the Receiver, and that to the unregenerate muſt be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Here then let us know, and arm our ſelves, that Sacraments being only Moral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, cannot convey any thing that is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al unto the ſoul by way of Obſignation, but only that which is Relative, making no change but as to our Eſtates, and relations to God; the very end or proper effect being chiefly to aſſure us thereof, I mean, make us more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, conſider, and lay them to heart, if good, for our comfort, if bad, for our conviction. Now this very aſſurance, as farther degrees of faith and love in the worthy Receiver, and hardneſſe in the unworthy, which are Real
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119920:30"/>things, are not externally exhibited, I ſay, by this ſealing, but internally wrought or effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted according to the acts and exerciſes of our Souls on thoſe objects, that may be ſaid thereby to have an influence on us. Now then, let an unregenerate man ſo come to the ſeal, that he lays cloſe to heart his damnable condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more humble and ſenſible of it, it has its very right effect upon him, and is a help towards his converſion, while it does not Phyſically conveigh Gods wrath, for that it cannot, but Morally work only the ſenſe of it on his Spirit, which if he lets wear off again, without amendment, his ſin of hardning will lie therein, and not in his coming.</p>
               <p>And now for my part, if I have fallen on the truth, yet am I nothing, for it has been my fears and doubtings have even brought me to it, who muſt ſadly confeſſe my ſelf to be ſuch a truant to the proficiency of grace, that I am juſtly turn'd down unto the lowermoſt form of ſuch poor ſinners that are jealous, and do even queſtion the ſincerity of it. Amongſt theſe, I have thought it ſafeſt, in coming to this Ordinance, to condemn my condition, and while I do ſo, methinks the Apoſtle ſpeaks comfortably to me, <hi>If we judge our ſelves, we ſhall not be judged.</hi> Poor ſouls! Is not this ſweet to you? Let it enter into your hearts, when you come in your tears, as it were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring hither; the very ſame place that has made you tremble in ſpeaking ſo dreadfully of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe, does yet aſſure you, but <hi>if you condemn your ſelves</hi> as unworthy, <hi>you ſhall not be condemned;</hi> I would not for any thing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119920:30"/>that paſſage were left out. The meek Ieſus will never ſpurn at thee, when thou lieſt down before him. O my ſoul! whiles others are even embrac'd in Chriſts arms, let me have but a hold of the hem of his garment; whiles they are as it were raviſht with the kiſſes of his mouth, let me be but ſo happy to lick up the very duſt that is at his feet; the leaſt hem of his righteouſneſs, the leaſt duſt of his mercy, ſhall have virtue enough in it to ſave me. For the cloze of this buſineſſe, as to the part of the Receivers, which I muſt yet leave to be judged of thoſe that are more able, I do humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech ſome moderate Spirit, that is good at a broken bone, to ſpeak ſome words in ſeaſon for the refreſhment of the weary, and deal not ſo roughly, as this man has dealt with me; for why ſhould you break a bruſed Reed, caſt down by the troubles of his ſoul? Why ſhould you call a man Marah moſt deſpitefully, becauſe the Lord hath ſent him bitterneſſe? And amidſt the reproaches that are fallen on me, will you throw more on me? If you will, I will go tell my Saviour of you, I will heartily pray him to forgive me, for fear I have deſerved them, and will be contented to be made conformable to him, though I am reviled in my agony, and have Vinegar in my croſſe.</p>

1. In that he doth not forbid it, which if it had been ſin, he muſt have done.2. In that he urges their very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, as a means and argument to reclaim them from Idols.3. In that he does as it were even give his aſſent in a plain precept for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.33. <hi>Wherefore when you come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119920:33"/>tarry one for another;</hi> Hereof I appeal to the judicious for this meaning, that their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming was good, and their diſorders to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>A tender Chriſtian may here object, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. againſt our mixt Communion, <hi>I would not have you have fellowſhip with Devills, you cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Table of the Lord &amp; the Table of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi> I anſwer, the Apoſtle ſpeaks not of divers perſons (in the whole Ch.) going to one Table, but of the ſame perſons going to divers Tables, and he plainly reaſons from their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the one againſt the other. From whence I argue, Thoſe that were engaged from going to Idolls, partook of the Lords Supper; but it was not the regenerate only, but all their intelligent Members were hereby engaged from Idols; <hi>Ergo,</hi> All their intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Members partook of the Sacrament, and were to partake of it, if the Apoſtles argument be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>As for his mollifying the word <hi>Drunken,</hi> I, diſapprove not; and if any man be quite ſo; I hold him unintelligent, and fit for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be turned away from all Ordinances.</p>
               <p>My third proof was from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4, 5. which, I think, if it be well laid to heart, might eaſe us of our ſcruples. Read <hi>Calvin Inst. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>ſect.</hi> 5. 6. who agrees with my explication of it. His objections are two, <hi>p.</hi> 28. 29.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſays, <hi>I ſpeak gratis in ſaying they were admitted to our Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I pray ſee the words, does Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak <hi>gratis?</hi> They did all eat the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119920:34"/>meat, and drank of the ſame ſpiritual drink, and Rock, which was Chriſt. Mark it, he ſays <hi>the ſame,</hi> not only the ſame thing ſignified, but the ſame ſymbolls, the ſame meat and drink, or the ſame Sacrament. So that Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> is miſtaken, and his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their Elements being not the ſame, is very low, as if becauſe we have ſometimes Sack, ſometimes Claret, we had not the ſame Sacrament. <hi>Calvin</hi> tells us, they enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>iiſdem ſymbolis,</hi> as the Text doth, which I conceive herein, that there was ſpecifically, the ſame Sacramental union, between the ſigns and things ſignified, in their, as our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements. They all drank of the Rock which was Chriſt, they did not all drink really of Chriſt, but ſymbolically, and ſo do we, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically then they are the ſame, that is, the ſame ſymbols, or Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Whereas he urges here, <hi>The uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Infants,</hi> again (which is now thrice) <hi>were admitted,</hi> his Argument will but ever come to this, becauſe our Scriptures ſometimes ſeem to prove more, therefore they cannot prove the leſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He brings in the ordinary ſhift, <hi>That this was neceſſary to preſerve their lives, and ſo they were admitted, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This I prevented, by ſhewing that to this very ſcope and purpoſe doth <hi>Paul</hi> parallel theſe Sacraments of theirs with ours, to let the <hi>Corinths</hi> know, that they had no other than the ſame privileges with the <hi>Iews,</hi> in their Fre-admiſſion. If he ſhould ſay I make no more of your coming freely hither, than of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119920:34"/>the <hi>Iews,</hi> all drinking of the Rock, it were no plainer to me than what he has ſpoken. He doth acknowledge it ſo, in finding ſuch a large inſtance to compare with it.</p>
               <p>For the difference he makes between our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements and theirs, which he ſays <hi>is manifeſt, namely, theirs was to nouriſh their bodies, as well as their ſouls,</hi> &amp;c. It is groſſe, and fit for none to ſay but the Papiſts, that hold there is left only the qualities of bread (that cannot nouriſh) in tranſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſays, <hi>They muſt have choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſtarved elſe,</hi> I ſay, if it be neceſſarily, ſin to Eat of Chriſt Sacramentally, unleſſe men are regenerate (as Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> holds) there is no doubt but they ſhould have rather dyed than be guilty of the blood of Chriſt; (which he phraſes murdering him) and have ſooner famiſht their bodies than damn'd their Souls. If it be not a ſin but accidentally; Here is a good reaſon indeed for their eating and drinking All of them: but what reaſon is there St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould parallel our eating and drinking with theirs, unleſſe it be true like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that we are to eat, <hi>All</hi> of us? it is not his bare ſaying <hi>The parallels do not run on four feet,</hi> will ſerve, for you may ſee he won't let the Apoſtle ſo much as ſtand on one, if he denies our Free admiſſion.</p>
               <p>Before I paſſe, I have two things heer for tender Chriſtians.
1. That to Eat Chriſt Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically, is no ſuch dreadfull thing as is made of it (I mean above other Ordinances, it is as ſinfull to uſe them unworthily as this) for <hi>Paul</hi> makes no account to ſay, they all drank Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119920:35"/>of him, provided always you come with reverence, both in regard of the nature of the inſtitution, and your own condition.2. That the want of grace is no juſt hinderance or excuſe from our profeſſion. There is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral profeſſion of God in oppoſition to all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, in which ſenſe I take it, the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only could ſo commonly be ſaid to enter Covenant, <hi>With all their heart, and all their ſoul,</hi> in ſome places. So there is a general profeſſion of Chriſt, that ſalvation only is in his name, which every Chriſtian may profeſſe truly, though he be no true profeſſor. It is a great weakneſſe of ſome that think for fear of hypocriſie, an unregenerate man may not do his duty. Hypocriſy, is either oppoſed to truth, which is diſſembling, ſuch an action that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill <hi>propter fieri</hi> muſt be avoyded; or to ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſuch an action that is evill only through accident of the doer, while in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it be good for all his evill diſpoſition, the thing ſtill muſt be done. A Chriſtians pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, (a pledge wherof is this Sacrament) may be hypocriſie in one ſenſe, but not in the other.</p>
               <p>My fourth proof was from the Parable of the Feaſt, <hi>Lu.</hi> 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. which I judge has more force in it than ſome think, though leſſe than others. Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> here is in a ſtreight; if he allow it applicable to this Supper, it is clear againſt him. <hi>The Servants bring in All both good and Bad.</hi> If he will not allow it, he doth not only go againſt the ſtream of Divines, (and that not ſolidly) but wreſts out of their own hands their main argument from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of him that had not the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119920:35"/>which being the act of the Lord, is not well applied neither. The truth is, the Feaſt does not ſignifie particularly the Supper; but it is as true it does it in general, as other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. The Feaſt is Jeſus Chriſt, ſet out in his Ordinances, and outward privileges, unto which there is a free acceſſe, and intereſſe of the Good and Bad within the Church, ſo that for the main, we have our full weight, that the Servants, whoſe office it is to be the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencers of the myſteries, have not any power for diſcrimination of the gueſts in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to the Feaſt; and therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they can prove it by ſome warrant other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, are not to judge of the worthineſſe and unworthineſſe of their Church-members, as to the offer of Chriſt, in this Supper. It is true, If men be ſcandalous, they are lyable to cenſure, but who does not ſee this upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, I mean of diſcipline, to ſatisfie the Church, amend them, and warn others. But if you do it upon this ground of ſetting up a diſcriminating Ordinance, I muſt ſpeak my Conſcience, I think it not according to the mind of the Lord of the Feaſt. Again, As for the unintelligent, as Infants and the like, who does not ſee, that the Feaſt is ſtill free, but they are uncapable? they make no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, but God does excuſe them, and ſo they cann't be compelled. But if you ſet up Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worthineſſe for a rule of Admiſſion, you aſſume a power of diſcriminating the gueſts; You may call it your zeal, your care, and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet is it a power (as well as a burden) even over Gods Ordinance, and differs as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119920:36"/>much from our Miniſterial inſtruction, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, and admonition, as a ſeparating the vile from the precious by the word of Gods mouth, and the doing it without, untill you prove it.</p>
               <p>And now for his four particulars, p. 30, 31. Firſt, <hi>He diſtinguiſhes between the feaſt, which is Christ, and the diſhes wherein he is ſerved, which are the Ordinances.</hi> This is ſomething ingenuous; but whereas he applies this, that a man may be invited to a feaſt, and yet not to the diſh in the feaſt; it is very fine if we ſhould ſerve him as the plain man did his Son, that pretended he could prove two eggs to be three, by his Logick; Well, ſays he, I will take the one, and your Mother the other, and now do you prove the third, and take it for your ſelf. Let us have the diſhes, and what will become of Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> feaſt? Thus <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and hardly beſtead, does he paſſe through it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He urges, <hi>Then ſhould Heathen be admitted. Anſ.</hi> And ſo they may, if they come in in an orderly way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. they muſt firſt have a right by Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and then being once within the Church, they are alike admitted to all privileges.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He addes, <hi>How were the unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gueſts alſo excluded</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 14?) and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers himſelf, Becauſe they would not come.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He tels us, <hi>Wordly buſineſſe ſomtimes may detain a man from the Sacrament, Numb.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Who doubts it, and yet the feaſt not neglected, if the buſineſſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119920:36"/>But as for the ſtrength of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon here, it is as good as the Fathers, that would have his Child excuſed to his Maſter, for not comming to School, becauſe he was dead.</p>
               <p>In the way, For my quoting that Text, <hi>Lu.</hi> 12.42. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> need not have given me ſuch ill words: I make no interpretation of them, but that it is the Miniſters duty, duly to diſpence the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which if he does do, they do not touch him, but may convince thoſe that think it their conſcience wholly to omit it, and this I hope may turn the edge of his rebuke. For my part I do not think my ſelf fit to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Mr. <hi>Drake,</hi> or the leaſt of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with the greateſt ſinners, and bow down my practice at the feet of Gods mercy. Forgive, O Lord, my failings, for they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven more than the hairs of my head! Yet do I think, that both thoſe that exclude all, and they that exclude any (who are neither Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligent, or Excommunicate) come ſhort in the importance of theſe Scriptures.</p>
               <p>My fifth proof was from <hi>Iohns</hi> Free-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, even of thoſe he calls Vipers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. upon that ground, <q>
                     <hi>Adultis eadem eſt ratio utriuſque Sacramenti.</hi>
                  </q> See <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.5. <hi>And they of</hi> Iudea <hi>went out, and were All baptized of him,</hi> that is, All that went out to him for Baptiſm were admitted; and yet Mr. <hi>Drake,</hi> as he is wont, anſwers me thus overly, <hi>He ſays, but proves not that</hi> Iohn <hi>baptized all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, p.</hi> 32. he ſhould ſay, He does not prove it, but only brings Scripture for it.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:119920:37"/>
               <p>This axiome (which I think I had of <hi>Pemble</hi>) he denies, <hi>p.</hi> 33. 1. <hi>Becauſe, Heathen may be admitted to Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I had thought when men had been converted to the faith once, they had been Chriſtians. 2. <hi>Becauſe it makes for him, ſeeing there was an outward confeſſion at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ</hi> Who would think it, he ſhould fly for ſhelter to this Sanctuary, even while he pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes it. You muſt take the meaning thus, There is <hi>Eadem ratio,</hi> but not <hi>in omnibus.</hi> It holds in the main, that the ſame faith which will admit one of age to be Baptized, will alſo admit him to this Sacrament, and that is an Hiſtorical faith only in profeſſion; yet as for making that confeſſion, though it he needfull at Baptiſm, in admitting them to be Church Members (as we are willing to know whom we enter into our ſociety) ſeeing we have Scripture for it; yet not at this Supper where we have none, for when men are Church-members already, their very coming is their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>My ſixt proof was <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 42, 46. Which Text he leaves out, you may conceive it has ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced him. For while we find thouſands admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thus freely and equally (not omitting his phraſe of Pell-mel) in their breaking bread (I ſay even wholy alike) as in doctrin and prayer we dare not fall down to that Sacramental Rule upon tryal he would ſet up, if it be once held as neceſſary and divine (though we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the prudence and piety of others) ſeeing it has not one word to ſpeak, or the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119920:37"/>leaſt argument left it concerning this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it ſhould <hi>open the mouth, or move the wing, or peep againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My ſeventh text was <hi>Act.</hi> 10.28. which I ſay, I apply only as to the expreſſion. Yet does he purſue it with four pitifull exceptions, <hi>p.</hi> 34, 35. For the firſt whereof it is untrue, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays not <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. the unbeliever is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean to us, but <hi>all things are unclean to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the ſecond I ſhall ſatisfie after I have propoſed this queſtion, in anſwer to his two other; Whether do you think him more pierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the third, to find only the unintelligent left out, or ingenuous in the fourth, to ſpeak ſo eloquently, when he has done? I have heard of one, that would undertake ye, to confute all <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in two words <hi>(Menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Bellarmine)</hi> by Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> language and confidence, he may be the man.</p>
               <p>And now for the force of theſe words, I told you in the beginning, we muſt diſtinguiſh of paſſages unto their right parties; there is a ſort of weak Chriſtians that think they ſhall be defiled if they Communicate in our mixt Churches; this text may be full and ſolid for them, though it reaches not others. Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> ſhould be more tender, than to debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their ſupports. Dear ſouls, I have ſeen ſome of your tears, and let this dry them up for you, you are not to account them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and unclean that receive with you, If your ſelves be clean, all are clean to you. The ſoul many times, that is not taken with a reaſon, may by an expreſſion. A man may be <hi>common
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119920:38"/>and unclean</hi> three ways,
1. Levitically, and this is abrogate;2. Morally, and this defiles a mans ſelf, and not another;3. Faederally, as appears in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. Now while perſons are Faederally clean, as all Church members are, being ſeparated by external Covenant to Chriſt from the World, we need not doubt but they may be communicated withall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pollution. Indeed Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> ſays heer, ſuch and ſuch are <hi>Morally unclean,</hi> but what then? It is not <hi>Moral cleanneſſe,</hi> but <hi>Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral cleanneſſe</hi> is the ground of our admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a man is not Faederally unclean till ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. He objects, <hi>wicked Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians reject Chriſt, p.</hi> 35. and anſwers himſelf with me, <hi>p.</hi> 84. <hi>Though they tranſgreſſe they do not renounce the Covenant as Turks do, and are Church Members till excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe were my Scriptures to eſtabliſh us, in this ſweet truth that leads us unto peace, and though he has done his endeavour to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you of the benefit of them, yet for all his oppoſition there is not ſo much as <hi>the girdle of their loyns looſed, or latchet of their ſhooes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the cloze herof I gatherd up ſome Texts, <hi>Io.</hi> 6.37. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. &amp;c. that do ſet forth the moſt free offers of Jeſus Chriſt, which though Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> makes but light of, <hi>p.</hi> 36. do pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically enter the ſpirits of others, that have but a little embraced this ſweet notion, that the Lord Jeſus is proportionably gracious in his external privileges to a Chriſtian profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he is in his internal ſaving benefits to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119920:38"/>the ſincerity of Chriſtianity. Heer he ſays three things, the one is, <hi>With what Conſcence can I keep off Infants?</hi> This is now four times. The other two are the ſame, which in their naked ſenſe comes to this: <hi>Though Christ be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered freely, yet it muſt be to ſuch only as we judge truly receive him.</hi> The truth is, the word and the Sacraments are but the ſame publick inſtrument, delivered as a ſealed wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the uſe of the Church, and are equal privileges (if I may call the ſame equal) to all the Members of it. I do even pity mortality, to ſee what a few words, a few enfoldings, can hide Truth from us; what ſenſe is in this? Jeſus Chriſt is to be freely ſhewed forth, to bring men home effectually to him, and yet muſt the Receivers make out their right unto the Miniſter, before we dare offer, or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally apply him to them.</p>
               <p>I do humbly conceive, heer is the falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that perplexes the many. We that are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters (they think) are ſent by our Prince Jeſus to our Flocks, as Rebels, to offer grace and ſalvation; if they come in and truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him, we are to ſeal their pardons; if they do not make this (viſibly) appear, we may not apply the ſeal, without being guilty of the blood of Chriſt. Now this is a very ill appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion (which we ſhall rectifie as we go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) for we muſt not make the notion of ſealing ſo dreadfull, and bring ſo much blood upon our ſouls. I think this is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in reference to the heathen, whom we need not fear to judge viſible Rebels, and they muſt come in and profeſſe Jeſus Chriſt in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119920:39"/>to all other Religions, before we can ſeal the Word to them. The Word is no ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Word (even outwardly) but to the Church; and when they are made Members once, it is then ſealed; we ſeal them an equal right to all Ordinances, and Privileges, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is exernal we confer to them. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received into the Church, and profeſſors already, we cannot compel any tryal of them more (unleſſe by way of Catechiſm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction wherein yet there is no man too old to learn, <hi>Lu.</hi> 14.) but it muſt be, as to the truth of their profeſſion, or effectual ſincerity, which for to do (where no ſcandal calls them in queſtion (it is to go about to judge mens) hearts, and to enter into the ſeat of God, and make our ſelves diſpenſers, not of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries only, but of the grace, while we take a power to judge of mens worthineſſe, and according to viſibility, ſeal them their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons. This is a buſineſſe of ſad conſequence to give occaſion, and ſome hold-faſt to thoſe Anti-chriſtian Scandals, are caſt on our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry by them that would undo us.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſſe I belive it was only the zeal and piety of good men, that made them thus to riſe up againſt ignorance and ſin, without intending to enter upon Gods Throne, but if we have erred, and muſt be laid down, it may be in the duſt, I hope we ſhall acknowledge his hand, and if he ſhall return our Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Rivers of Confuſion, where we have ſate down and wept, we will remember again our <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and when thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored us, our Harps now hanging on the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119920:39"/>Willows, we will ſing of thy goodneſſe, in the wonted ſongs of thy <hi>Syon.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For my anſwer to this which is all his weight, with but a very few grains more; we muſt know, The Miniſters of Chriſt are the Miniſters of the new Covenant to be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that is not of the Abſolute, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. which is ſecret, and belonging to Election,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119920:40"/>but of the Conditional Covenant, (or the Covenant in its conditional capacity) which is tenderable to all the world, and that more eſpecially applicable with a diſtinction of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward privileges or intereſſe to the Church. Now look what is the tenour of the Covenant, the Sacrament ſeals, and nothing elſe, for we both hold it is the ſame with the Word. Now I pray what needed ſuch a torrent of words in this plain caſe? May not I ſay to all, and every intelligent Church-member, If thou believe thou ſhalt be ſaved? and may not I ſeal to ſuch, what the Word ſayes? which he grants. And doe not all underſtanding men know, we cannot ſeal Jeſus Chriſt and his benefits to any, but on the Covenant terms, which is conditionally? Would one think Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> ſhould ask me ſuch a queſtion, p. 42. <hi>Dares Mr.</hi> Humphrey <hi>ſay to a perſon in the state of Nature, Sir, Be aſſured All the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the Covenant are actually yours? The language of every actual giving is, Chriſt is thine in particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, This is a manifeſt error, The language of the Sacrament, is the language of the Covenant, and that is not, Chriſt is thine, but Chriſt is thine if thou wilt believe. And who doubts but I dare ſay ſo to one in a ſtate of Nature, conceiving we know it not, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge thereof; even as unto one in a ſtate of Grace; Chriſt is thine upon the ſame terms, as he does to one viſibly worthy, yet really unworthy; that is, If thou do now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to accept of him. For, Let me ask him again, Dare Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> ſay to the viſibly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119920:40"/>nay to the moſt really holy, Sir, Chriſt is thine Abſolutely, as in particular, I aſſure thee of it. If he dare, he enters upon the abſolute Covenant, and the Ark of God, and ſayes what no Mortal may ſay; But if he can ſay only Chriſt is thine in particular upon the condition of the Covenant, Here is no more than may be ſaid unto others.</p>
               <p>If this will not ſuffice, but you ſtill think, though where a man is <hi>viſibly</hi> to be admitted, you can ſafely ſay to him, Chriſt is thine in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, whether he be in the ſtate of Nature, or the ſtate of Grace, ſeeing indeed you know it not, yet you dare not ſay ſo, when you find (which thing I utterly renounce to be viſibly undertaken) that ſome are yet in their natural eſtate; I anſwer, In my opinion, for all this, you may only take the language of the Covenant wholy aright, which is thus, Here is Chriſt, <hi>If thou ſincerely acceptest of him, to ſave thee, if not, to condemn thee, unleſſe thou repenteſt,</hi> and all is ſafe nevertheleſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſolidity of this anſwer, may appear the more by this mans weakneſſe to ſalve that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>p.</hi> 48. which otherwiſe cannot be don. It is this, <hi>Does not the Miniſter ſeal to a Lye, if he ſeal to the unworthy?</hi> He anſwers moſt miſerably, He does but ſeal to an untruth, not to a lye, ſo long as he comes in to the Elders, and is thought viſibly worthy by them; Well, But what if the Elders ſhould admit one viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unworthy, and the Miniſter judge him ſo to be, yet the major part carrying it, What ſhall become of him then? Here his untruth muſt be a lye again; It is not his pleading an
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119920:41"/>admonition, or that he cann't help it, will ſerve him, if it be poſſitively a lye, or a ſin to admit any that is viſibly unworthy, he may not offend his conſcience, and preſume upon God, though he loſt his place and life too. So that he muſt on neceſſity come over to us, and then he may know how neither to commit an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth nor a lye neither, by ſaying, He offers or applies Chriſt but conditionally, or upon his own terms, and then the door is open for our Free-admiſſion. The truth is, ſeeing that the Miniſter is Gods Embaſſadour, and what he does, is by his Commiſſion, we may as ſoon ſay <hi>The God of Iſrael can lie,</hi> as that the Miniſter ever ſeals an untruth, or lie either, in doing his office; but you may ſit down by my Expreſſion hereof, <hi>p.</hi> 49. <q>The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeals generally the truth of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (freely and abſolutely) to all engaging them unto it, but the intereſt of ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the benefits (as in the threats) is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way conditional, or according to the tenour of the Goſpel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>With my Readers leave, though this be both what is partly received, and ſufficient, I ſhall ſpeak a little more. The very body of our Religion, conſiſts in the knowledge of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and Application of it. Vnder the Covenant, comes in the knowledge of our ſelves, our ſtates, our Mediator, and what he has done for us. And under the Application, the Spirit, and his office, The Miniſtery, and the Church. For what concerns us here; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Covenant, we are to know the tenour of it, and the ſeal of it. The tenour of it is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119920:41"/>apparent, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. For the ſeal, Let us conſider, It is either the Real, true, effectual Seal, that ratified this Covenant between God and Chriſt; and that is his blood, <hi>Heb. 9.</hi> or the Symbolical, External ſeal, which is only a repreſentation of this unto us; and that is the Sacrament. Concerning the Application, we muſt know two things, the Applyer, and the Subject to whom it is applyed, Both are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe External, or Internal. The Internal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer is the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe work is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd the ſeal of the Spirit, This glorious perſon cannot be called a ſeal otherwiſe (but by a Metonomy of the effect) as he is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Miniſter, to apply the Covenant both in working the condition, and ſealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The External Applier is our ſelves (the Miniſters) who are but his Earthen Veſſels, while the Excellency of the power we muſt leave freely unto him. For the ſubject to whom it is applyed, It is the Church. This is manifeſt, Chriſt Ieſus did lay down his blood for the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23, 25. The Church then likewiſe is either the inviſible, which conſiſts of ſuch mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that are truly in Chriſt; or the viſible, of all ſuch as do profeſſe him, as outward mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof. Now by the bleſſing of God, our work may be done, if we do but rightly ſort theſe things together; The Internal effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual ſeal, with the Internal effectual Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the External ſeal with the external application. The Effectual ſeal of the precious blood of Chriſt is in the hand only of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Miniſter, to apply it to the inviſible
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119920:42"/>

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:119920:43"/>Members, in whoſe hearts he both writes the new Covenant, and ſeals it. The Outward ſeal of the Sacrament is in the hand of the Outward Miniſter, to apply it to the viſible Church, and the Members thereof. Now let but the External Miniſter take heed of entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching on the Internal Miniſters office, as he would look to his life, in not medling with Gods Ark, and I hope the fear of God may end the controverſie between us.</p>
               <p>For his other thing here, He grants <hi>We have proved that All may, or are to be preſent, but that must be all, If it be applyed ſo, tis death, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I am very ſorry to ſee what a frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing man is, how every little trick and trifle can put us off.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If there be ſuch a ſtreſſe to be laid on Actual receiving, (which the Lord forbid) yet may the Miniſter be Free in his offer, in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Sacrament in general, as Chriſt ſays, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Take, Eat,</hi> in the plural number, and while he ſate at Table. There are 4 or 5 reaſons given by others for this way; but that which moves me moſt, is this our own reaſon, that tis a viſible word. Let the Miniſter then deliver it in general to his Congregation as he preaches the word; And while he declares to the whole Church <hi>This is the body of Christ which was broken for you,</hi> the Receivers make application to their own parts. Now if any Receiver who judges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unworthy, ſhould wave his very Taking onely unto the reſt, it might ſeem a kind of tender confeſſion, and act of humility. And
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119920:43"/>ſo let but the buſineſſe lie there, and the offer of Chriſt ſhall be free, yet no guilt on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; and the adminiſtration free, and no guilt on the Receiver. The Miniſter doe his office, and the people their duty, and both pleaſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This I ſpeak as to mens ſcrupulous ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, but I muſt confeſſe (though I like a delivery in General, rather than particular) I can no ways endure the rending theſe ſacred actions one from another; When Chriſt has ſaid, <hi>Doe this,</hi> this thing, or Doe thus, as it ſeems the <hi>Syriack</hi> reads it, that is after the ſame manner, <hi>Drink ye All of it, and they all drank of it,</hi> I think it an injury to the holy inſtitution, to ſeparate what Chriſt has joyned, as the Papiſts do, in withholding the Wine from the Laity. I muſt confeſſe this is a device ingenuouſly framed to ſerve the turn, and I fear it has got it ſelf reverence in the hearts of ſome godly men; yet does it ſeem to me a thing but of ſad conſequence to us, and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to God. For either this preſence muſt be held neceſſary, as our general duty, or left at our liberty: If we hold they may be preſent onely, and bind not any to it as a duty, who does not know, that there is the confluence of the Word, Prayer, Singing, Meditation, in the adminiſtration, which to lay waſt is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen impiety, and unbidding thoſe things, which are queſtlonleſſe yeelded to be means of converſion: But if we hold it (as certainly it is) to be our duty, not to neglect ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſo that we muſt come to the Sacrament, yet if we offer but to take and eat, this Actual
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119920:44"/>receiving onely, ſhall be our damnation; The ſinful adoration that was brought on the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the conceit of Real preſence corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, had not ſo much dread in it, though more ſupenſtition. Nay, let us conſider a little, ſhall prophane men, while they ſtay the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, think themſelves ſecure from guilt, ſo long as they do not eat and drink, only, as if the Covenant and the Seal was not otherwiſe applied to them, What hardneſſe on their hearts? What ſenſual apprehenſions will this bring on them? Nay, what unholy and contemptible thoughts of the God of Heaven, that looks on us, as if he regarded our very eating and drinking more than our ſpirits? Not that I am ſo moved at Free-preſence (let the prudent judge of it) but that actual recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is not as free to our intelligent members. Indeed if perſons be Excommunicate, (as the Primitive Church did puniſh ſuch with bare preſence) or men have their gather'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, if they do not communicate with thoſe that are preſent, and hear, their reaſon is open, they own them not as their members; but as for us that are not yet convinc'd by them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muſt maintain, or new mold our mixt Congregations.</p>
               <p>This for his crop in general, there are ſome Ears yet ſtanding to be cut down in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>P. 37. <hi>If the Sacrament have the ſame lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with the Word, then a Heathen may receive it as a Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He has here left out my main caution <hi>[Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin the Church.]</hi> Let us know, the Goſpel
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119920:44"/>may be conſidered as the Bare word, or a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led word; As an inſtrument in the writing to be declared, and read over to all, or as a ſealed inſtrument delivered to peculiar uſe. Or the Word may be conſidered as to the publiſhing the contents and tender of the Covenant, or to the appropriation of privilege we have in it. <hi>To the Jews belonged the ſacred Oracles, and the Covenants;</hi> The contents might be preached to bring in proſelytes, yet are they ſaid truly with diſtinction of outward privilege, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to them. If you like not my phraſes, you may make better, but here lies the point; The blood of Ieſus Chriſt does peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, by way of appropiation, to the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23.25. This blood ſeals the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Sacrament repreſents that blood: Now as the Spirit applies the Effectual ſeal on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the inviſible Church; ſo the Miniſter can apply the outward ſeal onely to the viſible. Though the Word then may be declared to Heathens, It cannot be ſealed to them, but when they turn Chriſtians. The Covenant is a ſealed Covenant only to the Church. There is this diſtinction of privilege as it belongs to us, that it is ſealed in the outward application thereunto, that ſo every Member (without a juſt forfeiture) has a publick right, in the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>P. 38. <hi>There are ſome righteous perſons in their own conceit, many ſelf-Juſticiaries, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Of all men I think that ſuch as theſe had need moſt of conviction, but I find not the Scripture ſends out any ſpiritual Hue and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119920:45"/>Cry, to make ſearch for them; if it did, I will not for any thing ſay who are the men; but ſure ſome Miniſters, upon certain marks, might begin with their own Elders: nay I think, upon the main known mark of <hi>I thank God I am not like other men</hi> (if you ſee Mr. <hi>D. p.</hi> 90.) ſome Elders might take up their own Miniſter, upon ſuſpition.</p>
               <p>P. 39. <hi>All may be preſent at the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as at Preaching, and Baptiſm, but that All ought Actually to partake, —will lead thouſands into utter darkeneſſe.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not to mention his unhandſom lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, where the ſenſe is ſo dreadfull, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If a man ſwear by the Temple it is nothing, but the gold of the Temple makes him guilty.</hi> If a man partake of the whole adminiſtration beſides, it is nothing for all his unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but if he actually receive, he becomes a debtor. Which is greater, the bare eating and drinking, or the whole ſacred inſtitution and conſecration, that ſanctifies the action?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not his inſtance of Baptiſm, will waſh off this ſuperſtition, wherein this good man has taken a deadly conceit, for there are no actions here to be repeated; the weakneſſe is clear as its own water. But I argue, if a man is bound at this Ordinance to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward application (together with the Word) of what is repreſented, though the outward ſign is forbidden, as to be twice uſed; How ſhall we deny both the inward and outward application alſo in the Supper, where both are commanded? The truth is, the very ſealing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119920:45"/>the Covenant, applies wrath to every impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and life to every one that has true faith, whether we ſhould ſee it only, or receive it. And if it be not <hi>eating commends us unto God,</hi> I do not ſtand upon this outward receiving, as any thing conſiderable, in compariſon of the reverential application of the Covenant, in a right uſe of it, according to our condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For admiſſion of all intelligent Church-members, I am free; but as for their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, I have ſpoken more tenderly, than his ſpeeches. Yet will I confeſſe my preſent inclination is thus, I hold, A man muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf (I place much on this) and ſo receive according to his eſtate. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>John</hi> to deſtroy <hi>Ahab; Iohn</hi> his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is evil in it, and does but commit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which God will puniſh, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.4. yet nevertheleſſe muſt the thing be done, and as commanded, it is both approved, as good, and rewarded, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.30. Chriſt Ieſus ſays to his Church, <hi>Doe this;</hi> Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> ſays, If an unregenerate member does it, he ſhall (I muſt ſay only he may) become guilty of Chriſts blood in the action. Nevertheleſſe it is not his diſpoſition being not right, that can nullifie Gods precept, but that he muſt both examine himſelf, and ſo eat.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas then, He thinks my opinion will lead many thouſands to Hell, I am hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly afraid that his will do it; I do profeſſedly charge every ſoul, that they look well into their conſcience what they embrace, and the Lord be their direction. For my part, I am thinking, when Ieſus Chriſt ſhall call us both
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119920:46"/>to account at the great day; he will ſay to me, Why have you brought in all unto my feaſt? I ſhall ſay, Lord, even as thou haſt commanded, Thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Do this, Drink ye all of it,</hi> and I muſt not miſtruſt the goodneſſe of thy word, and thy gracious efficacy to go along with it. I durſt not for my life make void thy bleſſed command. And what then, if he ſhall ſay to Mr. <hi>D.</hi> And why have you, contrary to my expreſſe words, taught your own Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the precept of God, that it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate mans duty to abſtain? When I ſaid <hi>Doe this,</hi> you have ſaid Doe it not, unleſſe you be ſure you can alſo <hi>ſo</hi> do it; whereby you have ſtrengthned the Careleſſe, hardned the impenitent, and afflicted tender Conſciences, laying waſte this Ordinance of mine in many places, whereas one ought ſtill to be done, and not leave the other undone: Let me ſeriouſly forewarn this pious man, that while he has laid that text, <hi>Ez.</hi> 13.22. ſo heavy on my ſoul, that he provide himſelf to anſwer unto it.</p>
               <p>P. 40.41. He brings in my <hi>Simile,</hi> but takes hold of it by the left handle; We muſt not think as we are Miniſters ſet over Chriſts flock, we are ſent to them as Externally Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, that they muſt come in and profeſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, to be admitted to thoſe privileges, which they have a right to already, as well as we. No, the main point of the <hi>Simile</hi> lies here, that the Inſtrument of peace, committed to us, is a ſealed Inſtrument, the word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is a ſealed word to all the Church, Every member has an equal right to the Seal,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119920:46"/>as the writing, and we cannot pluck off, or put on, our Lords ſeal at our pleaſure. It is a weak conceit, that we are ſent to our Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as it were with their pardons unſealed, to try whether they truly ſubmit, and according to our judgement, to ſeal them. We muſt conceive our Seal is ſet by Chriſt himſelf to his own Proclamation, and we have no other than what belongs to the whole Church; But if we look any further than Church-memberſhip, we enter the office of the inward Miniſter, and take a power of medling with the inward ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which does not belong to us. It is the want of diſcerning between theſe inward and outward things, has miſlead Mr. <hi>D.</hi> who has not yet conſidered how the Covenant is a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Covenant, to all that are but Chriſts exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal people, and that this Seal is a ſtanding ſeal, &amp; both Covenant and Seal make up one publick inſtrument for the uſe of the Church. We may ſee this in Circumciſion (from whence we bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the notion of a ſeal) Gen. 17. <hi>I will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh my Covenant between are and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man child among you ſhall be circumciſed.</hi> Here you ſee how it is a ſtanding ſeal ſet to the Covenant, and both eſtabliſhed with the whole ſeed, ſo that by this one act as it were, of publick delivery, Every Church-member (that was then any one of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed,) had a right to the ſeal without any more plea, as other publick privileges, for ever after in their generations.</p>
               <p>Now whereas he puts the caſe, that ſome who come to the Sacrament are but Rebels,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119920:47"/>and how ſhall we ſeal unto them? I anſwer, we cannot judge of the hearts of any that they are inward Rebels, and we may not judge that they are outwardly ſo, when they outwardly come in, unleſſe we haue ſomething to allege againſt them to prove their Rebellion, and then if it be ſuch as deſerves it, they may be Excommunicated, but while they are Church Members, we cannot deny them their common privileges. But for his expreſſions, <hi>Of their ſeeming to ſubmit, yet carrying Daggers, and Poyſon about them to murder their Prince, and therefore they muſt be ſearched, &amp;c.</hi> Beſides the vanity of the words, I muſt tell him,
1. There is no Scripture that warrants his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended tryal of Church Members, about their coming to the Sacrament, that is flat.2. Much leſſe, that he may take a power of ſearch as to the truth of grace, which is an entring on Gods Throne, and the Spirits work.3. This is clean contrary to Chriſts example, who ſet up no Sacramental tryal for <hi>Iudas,</hi> at leaſt for any thing we can find of it. But alas, that is nothing to Mr. <hi>Drake,</hi> he has found out a way to turn this off with a wet finger, <hi>p.</hi> 9. &amp; 90. Which if you confer with this paſſage, he tels us, <hi>That they who are the Servants, by all means muſt needs try, examine, and keep men away, for fear of ſome ſecret Treaſon unto Chriſt in coming hither;</hi> but Jeſus Chriſt the Lord himſelf, muſt not have power to make tryal of, or ſuſpend <hi>Iudas</hi> that really intends to murder him, becauſe the Presbytery was not ſetled.</p>
               <p>To <hi>p.</hi> 44. I anſwer, <hi>Godly Parents and Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119920:47"/>instruction of their Children and Servants unto the Lords Supper,</hi> may be good, as the Miniſters Catechizing them, without this ill language he heer gives me. I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow a man ſome Salt in his diſcourſe, but his is briniſh; there are ſome ingredients to be in ones Inck beſides Gall.</p>
               <p>To that queſtion, what Chriſt ſealed to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, p.</hi> 46, 47, 48. without regard to the reſt, which is amiſſe, I judge he ſpeaks well herein, <hi>The word and the ſeal both go together, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure particular mercy or judgment to the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as they are worthy and unworthy,</hi> that is, according to the Covenant-tenour, and their own condition. This is good, though his compariſon of the bitter water following this, and that the Sacrament can never do good to any, but ſuch as are good already, ſeems to me ſuch a ſlander of that precious Ordinance, I would not be guilty of for all Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> is worth. But I pray conſider this really, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Chriſt does in his Miniſtry, muſt be a gracious act, and be capable of gracious ends, ſo that this action muſt be in its own nature a means to have done him good, if he had made a good uſe of it, and tis accidental to the thing, he did it not. Yet did Chriſt, in this actual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of his, Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> ſays truly, ſeal to him judgement, (you muſt conceive it, as to his own part in Receiving, for the Miniſter ſeals no intereſt but conditionally.) Now the truth is, as the Word is a ſweet ſavour to God, and a means of ſalvation, in his threatnings as well as its promiſes, becauſe it does but ſtill declare the Covenant, whereof they are parts of it; ſo
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119920:48"/>is the Sacrament, while it ſeals judgement, or while it ſeals life, ſeeing it does but ſeal the Covenant equally in both. Here then I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive ſtill (ſubmitting my ſelf unto mercy) lies the main upon the Receivers, to examine their hearts, and ſo to come in their addreſſes to Chriſt, that they rightly apply the Covenant unto themſelves, according to their condition. Always carrying in mind theſe two things; Firſt, That thou put far enough aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bleſſed work of ſealing the Covenant, though it denounces thy judgement unleſſe thou repenteſt, (for it does it no otherwiſe) and that curſed ſin of thy abuſe hereof (if thou doſt not lay it to heart) in eating damnation. Secondly, That what the Word denounces, and Sacrament ſeals, they conveigh not Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but only Relatively, for they are not Phyſical, but Moral inſtruments, (which Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> did not think of in his bitter compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) ſo that while they aſſure thee of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they do thee no hurt, if thou make a good uſe of them for thy conviction, but if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, as all means elſe, they ſerve but to encreaſe it. You may happily ſay this notion is ſtrange, but is it not true, and as for the ingredients, what every one yield? who will deny the Sacrament is a viſible word? Does not the word ſay, <hi>he that believes not,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, <hi>is damned?</hi> that is, is in a preſent ſtate of death. Muſt not every one lay this eſtate of his to heart? Does not the ſeal aſſure the ſame thing only with the Word? Is not our Receiving, the application of what is ſealed? And is not the application, or ſetting home
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119920:48"/>the right part of the Covenant on a mans ſoul, the very buſineſſe (by the grace of God) of his conviction, and converſion? What then remains, but that man have the information, and God the glory?</p>
               <p>He repeats often, <hi>Where the word is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, neither the Sacrament.</hi> This is his ſtrength, and I cloze with him, and urge, But if every man is to apply the Word; and while he is impenitent, he is to lay to heart the threatnings, and wrath of God, as the only way to mollifie, and work him to repentance; then it is clear the ſeal may be applyed ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <hi>The Seal and the Word</hi> (he ſpeaks fully) <hi>muſt go together.</hi> If you offer to ſay it ſeals not this part of the Covenant, but only the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and grace, then you take away all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as it is ſealing to the moſt unworthy, and make our admiſſion more free; though if any dare ſay it ſeals not the whole Covenant, you may as well believe it is no ſeal at all.</p>
               <p>P. 51. He has Infants up again, which is now five times, but for his words, <hi>Shall the Supper be free for Blaspemers, Murderers, &amp;c.</hi> (which, who doubts but may be excommunicated, if not put to death) and his undertaking to prove his rule of viſibility to the Sacrament, to be as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly as Baptiſm, it is like himſelf, to ſay all day, and prove at night.</p>
               <p>For his anſwers to my 4 Conſiderations, I reply as briefly. To the firſt, An hiſtorical faith ſuffices unto Baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13. To the ſecond, Acceptance is either in ſincerity, which we cannot ſearch; or outward only and viſible, and that for Church-members, is their
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119920:49"/>receiving. As for any other, the Scriptures he pleads <hi>as abundant enough,</hi> are none at all; but if ill words will do it, he has authority enough. To the third, where are many things, I ſay,
1. Though conviction is not enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert without grace, what then? Is it not a means therefore with it?2. His implicated errors are his own, for conviction of the truth of the Covenant, does come directly by ſealing it, and conviction of the general offer, by the applying it to every ſingle perſon. I think ſome nicety between offering and applying (which as to the Miniſter is the ſame) trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the man, But3. Conviction, that Chriſt is mine in particular, as to <hi>a faith of particular evidence,</hi> as he expreſſes it, comes not at all by the Sacrament; Becauſe
1. The Sacrament ſeals nothing but the Word, which ſpeaks not particularly, I believe,2. What is common to the Hypocrite, with the true Believer, cannot bring any evidence to me. So that this ariſes onely from the teſtimony of my own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Spirit of God. If this man were leſſe confident, he might come to know more, and be better informed.</p>
               <p>To the Fourth, It is true, the Goſpel may occaſion diviſions, as the Bridge doth the tumults, and noiſe of the Waters, but I think it no way of the Goſpel, that goes about to make them. Let the wiſe, peaceable and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>mark</hi> the cauſe, <hi>and avoid it.</hi> As Factions are in State, Separations are in the Church; you ſhall never unite, ſo long as you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ground of them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119920:49"/>not how to allay them again, and you ſhall ſooner divide them into more Schiſms, to ruine both the Miniſter and the Church, than reduce them to what they were: For the ſpirit of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion being once up, will be ſtill fetching in more and more fewel to our opinions. Even as the Magician (in the Fiction, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarius Hiſt.

A certain Friend over-hearing theſe words, would needs do the ſame: He takes a ſtake, ſpeaks thoſe Words, It turns to a Spirit, fetches him fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he had enough, he bids it ceaſe, and bring no more; but having not the Words to charm it back into its ſelf, that continues; He fearing, takes an Ax, cuts it in two: upon this, inſtead of one, there is two men fetching fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, never leaving, till they had almoſt brought both him and the houſe unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>

The viſible Church is a number of ſuch as make profeſſion of Ieſus Chriſt. This I take to be the very nature thereof, and profeſſion of Chriſt reciprocal with it. The Eſſential notes, that is, (I count) thoſe things wherein this profeſſion is ſet forth, are the Word and Sacraments. I know many grave Divines do adde a third note of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and ſome include it under them; but I think this rather conduces to the well-being, than the being of the viſible Church. I do not doubt but our Churches where we have no diſcipline eſtabliſht, are yet true Churches, but if we ſhould not have the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Word and Sacraments, though the inviſible Church might be amongſt us, yet not the viſible. <hi>Nos aſſerin us</hi> (ſays <hi>Calvin</hi>) <hi>Eccleſiae formam non externo splendore, ſed longè aliâ not â contineri, nempe purâ verbi Dei pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatione, &amp; Sacramentorum adminiſtratione.</hi> Now what does <hi>competere</hi> eſſentially to the Church, as viſible, muſt <hi>competere</hi> to every Member, in <hi>ſtatus quo,</hi> ſo that ſo long as a man is a Church-member, he cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd this profeſſion in the publick marks of theſe Ordinances.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Would you ever imagin this ſame ſix times repeated thing (and ever provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt) ſhould be all now he has to ſay, and yet tell us it is apparent, when as to us poor mortals, it ſeems nothing at all? Let me ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here certifie you once again, that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyns us to examine our ſelves, and diſcern the Lords body, it doth not excuſe any of age, but they are both to do ſo, &amp; come, both to prepare and eat: We muſt do what we can ſtill, when we cannot do as we ought, and if we receive no good by it, it will be our ſin; but as for Infants, &amp;c. we manifeſtly know, there is no ſuch thing, it is no ſin of theirs if they are not fit to come. For igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance then and ſcandall, if it be not ſuch as makes us forfeit our Church Memberſhip (that is become excommunicate) it cannot <hi>contradict our outward profeſſion;</hi> for a viſible profeſſor and Church Member, I think are tearms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible, and that very Church Memberſhip and profeſſion, lies in the communion of theſe Ordinances.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is a difference between what is done juridically, by compulſion, and what is done only as prudential, by advice; Between forbearance, and excluſion. I think a man may conſcionably forbear his coming ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon many occaſions, and much more upon pious ends regarding preparation. My ground is, becauſe affirmative precepts oblige us <hi>ſemper,</hi> but not <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> ſo that there may
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119920:51"/>be much of Chriſtian prudence uſed in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our more ſolemn duties; upon which account only, I take it, are Godly Parents and Maſters to be commended in this thing, ſo long as they follow them with inſtruction, and ſo may thoſe Spiritual Fathers, that go no farther in the like admonitions.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not to return evil words, I humbly anſwer, if this do not conclude againſt him, yet does it conclude againſt them I more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to convince, than him; when ſome cannot afford the Sacrament at all to our mixt Churches. I may truly tell Mr. <hi>Drake,</hi> it was no intent of mine to diſpute with him, or offend any, but that we might ſit under our own Vines, and drink of the Wine thereof with our people in peace, without theſe ſour grapes being put into it.</p>
               <p>P. 55, 56. He inſtances the Rubrick, and Exhortation in the Book of Common-prayer, which I believe little thought to be made uſe of to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> For the Rubricks allowing the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to ſuſpend ſome notorious evil livers, I take it upon the account of <hi>ipſo jure</hi> Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, the end being expreſt to ſatisfie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. For the Exhortation, [whereas it mentions only heinous ſins (<hi>If any of you be blasphemers, adulterers, in malice, or any
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119920:52"/>grievous ſin, &amp;c.</hi>) we may diſtinguiſh happily between ſins that cannot ſtand with ſincerity, which no wilfull ſin (we hold) can, or with profeſſion, as Church-members; it may be it reaches not the firſt, but the laſt, upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer account. While a man is guilty of that deſerves a cenſure, if convicted, he may hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſentence himſelf, unto a more ſolemn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, before he comes, and give no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But if you apply it to all known ſin] I am willing to take it, as matter of prudenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al advice onely (with godly Mrs before) in this ſenſe, <hi>If any of you are actually in ſome ſin unrepented of, (as malice, &amp;c.) you may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear this Sacrament at preſent, ſo long as you reſolve to prepare your ſelves againſt the next; But if you ſhall wholly refuſe to come, you are to know how ſorely you offend God upon theſe terms, to neglect his Ordinance.</hi> But for Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> now, methinks he ſhould bluſh to produce me this authority, which himſelf deſpiſes. I would wiſh him ſeriouſly to ponder their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Exhortation with this, and therein weigh theſe words, as given us from their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Whereas you offend God if you do refuſe his holy Banquet, I admoniſh you, that unto this ſin you will not adde any more, by ſtanding by as gazers, and not partaking your ſelves of it. This makes the fault much greater, and is a farther contempt, having the myſteries of Chriſt in deriſion. Is it not ſaid, Take ye, and Eat, Take and Drink ye all of this? With what fate then ſhall you hear theſe words? Will not this be a neglecting, deſpiſing, and mocking the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of Ieſus Chriſt?</hi>

               <p>P. 56. He acknowledges <hi>this practice of his were against the well-being of a true viſible Church, if the Lords Supper were a privilege due to all members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I think herein his cauſe is yeelded (to all cleerly, but what we have excepted) for there is an Inward right or privilege to this Ordinance, which is inviſible, we here ſpeak not of; and Outward, or viſible right, and that is Church-memberſhip. As for the ſubdiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this, to be more remote, or immediat, found out by ſome, we cannot receive without warrant from Scripture.</p>
               <p>I pray look unto the Paſſeover, what gave a man right to that? See <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>Every circumciſed perſon ſhall eat thereof.</hi> There was nothing but a mans entring into the viſible <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Church, was the ground of his admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17. The Sacrament is the Communion, or token of our Communion in Jeſus Chriſt; Now I argue, If every Church-member <hi>in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu quo,</hi> is in Chriſt <hi>Io.</hi> 15.2. externally a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his blood, ſo as to ſanctifie him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. and redeem him, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. then he has, I hope, an immediate right to that which is but a token hereof; So long as he is in communion, how can he be debarr'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? Theſe outward things muſt go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you muſt cut him off Relatively from communion with Chriſt, or the Church, be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119920:53"/>you can deny him the outward pledge of his profeſſion. While he is in the body, he may partake of the body, The Church is the body of Chriſt, and ſo long as we are <hi>one body, we are one bread, and partakers of that one bread.</hi> There needs even nothing here, methinks, but drawing the curtain, and you ſee it day all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> does well to ſpeak for himſelf, for if there be any thing in this good Government he means, hangs by Geometry, it is this ſuſpenſion, while he places it in the air between Admonition and Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As for his argument from the greater to the leſſe, we know it holds not, but in things of the ſame kind: Now Excommunication is of divine inſtitution, but where will you find his ſuſpenſion? ſo that his Reaſon truly, is this, Becauſe he may exerciſe that which is a Church cenſure allowed in the Word, which is the greater; therefore he may ſet up that which is no Church cenſure, which is the leſſe. The caſting ſcandalous perſons out of the Church, with due caution, is I think of Divine right, but the Excommunicating a man from one Ordinance, ſo that he is ſtill a Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber otherwiſe, is to me an opinion <hi>upon the hearth unturn'd.</hi> The lump is the Church, and I ſee not how the leaven can be ſaid pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out, while it is a part of it. Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation therefore, I judge, does properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Church-ſociety in general, or Church-memberſhip;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119920:53"/>and all the Ordinances Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as I take it. An Excommunicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I doubt not may be admitted to ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as the word (and it may be prayer, as the Church thinks fit) to do him good, while he is kept from others, as the Sacrament, yet is he not to be accounted hereby a Church-member. He may come to hear in the ſtate of a Heathen, as the word is publiſhed to all, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. But as the Word is a Sealed Word, and belongs with diſtinction of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to the Church, he is Relatively cut off from his intereſt in it. So that he is to reckon himſelf (for all this common favour) as one external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt off from the Church, and all her Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that the terror thereof may drive him to repentance, and bring him home. And upon this account only of being (Relatively) out of the body, do we juridically debar him (as I hold) communion of the body.</p>

1. Sir, Publick Confeſſion will hardly down, and Auricular we do not approve.2. Chriſt ſometimes converſed too with the Phariſes, I hope to do good upon them.3. I
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119920:55"/>had thought Chriſt had often companyed with ſinners, to bring them to repentance, and not with ſuch only as were penitent already, and that I think, <hi>applyed here,</hi> makes little for you.</p>
               <p>P. 60: He brings in ſome expreſſions of mine with amazement, the ſenſe whereof, (as harmleſſe as the words) is but this, <q>I judge Chriſts act of admitting <hi>Iudas,</hi> hath been generally prevalent with the Church, for Free-admiſſion, and that it might yet be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, but that men are not now ſo willing to receive it.</q> For my part, I do but declare herein, according to our former Church, with the practice of Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and ſuch godly men that have gone before us. And as for ſuch that are now otherwiſe minded, I reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence them, I have no evil thoughts of them, the Lord knows it, Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> need not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, and ſo direfully, firſt accuſe me, then condemn me for what he forges, as if I deſerved to be more than ſuſpended, which in his ſenſe, makes me tremble, it ſhould enter into his heart Ah Lord! Is this the temper of holy men? Judge me, try me, (though I am vile o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and moſt unworthy) if herein there be any iniquity in me, why I ſhould be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the pit of Hell, even irrecoverably, if thy mercy did not exceed this mans infirmity. Thou ſeeſt, theſe cenſures are things too ſharp to be put into the hands of ſuch Children of thine, who have ſo little diſcretion for to uſe them, and it may be the effect of thy Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdom, to keep their knives away from them, when they are ready to do ſuch ſhrewd
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119920:55"/>turns with them. <hi>It may be the Lord will look on my affliction, and require me good for his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this day.</hi>

Our ſad experience has made this argument too weighty for Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> particulars, which are not worth the naming, unleſſe he could firſt prove it the Miniſters duty, to diſcern between the worthy and unworthy, as the rule of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw two <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fighting, he parted them, and made them friends, but when he ſaw an <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſtriving with an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> he ſaved the <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the life of the <hi>Egyptian.</hi> If this rule of viſibility had any foundation in the Scriptures, we ſhould certainly endeavour to reconcile theſe texts to it; but when it has not any at all, and yet is ſtriving againſt our peace and unity, humility and charity, we muſt ſave the <hi>Iſraelite:</hi> theſe duties muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, whatſoever becomes of this oppoſite thing that contends with it.</p>
               <p>Not that I hold all judging unlawfull, for I doubt not, but there may be both a Publick, and private judging; Publick judgement is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Civil cauſes, or Church-cenſures, both
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119920:56"/>which are ſufficiently warranted in the word upon due conviction. Private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is either upon ones ſelf, or upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I think ſometimes the one may be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as the other without ſin, and that not only, in caſe of outward actions which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent tranſgreſſion, but in ſome charitable ſuſpitions upon occaſion (as <hi>Iob</hi> over his Sons) tending to admonition. This I do ſpeak, that I may not abate from the zeal and piety of any over their relations, though we allow a free-communion.</p>
               <p>For his 9 things, <hi>p.</hi> 62, 63, 64. I return briefly, 1. A judging ones ſelf as worthy, and unworthy unto the Sacrament, is private, but ſound judgement. A judging others as to the truth and ſincerity of grace, though publick, is not, I think, a warranted judgement. But a judgement of probability, as to a viſible fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and unfitneſſe, upon a charitable jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, may be ſolid, as to advice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, but not, as to be a rule of admiſſion, or ſuſpenſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The cenſures of the Church upon Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or ſcandal, after due admonition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, will ſtand firm (as they have ever done) without this judging at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Epheſus</hi> is commended for her tryal of the falſe Apoſtles, as to their doctrine, not for a trial as to the Sacrament.

               <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 12, 13. ſpeaks of the like Excommunication from the whole lump, that the evil report of ſuch a notorious action (I take it) might not leaven their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches reputation, by his being reckond of their company.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The trial of the Miniſters at our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, hath expreſſe warrant for it, but there is no Scripture ſets up a tryal of our members unto the Communion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The gentleneſſe required of an Elder, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25. will hardly ſtand with Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> ſpirit, which makes <hi>him</hi> the more unfit for this trial, if it were meet in others.</p>

For my part, while he can even wiſh the earth might open and ſwallow me up, I deſire the Lord to open his eyes, that he may ſee the rents he helps to make, to ſwallow up the Church: And though he obtain not his wiſh as to the Earth, yet has he prevailed much as to the waters, which have overflowen my ſoul, and even been ready to ſwallow that up, with the ſorrows and woundings of my heart under theſe his bitter accuſations. <hi>The Lord executeth judgement and righteouſneſſe for the oppreſſed.</hi>

               <p>Alas Sir! Is it any advantage unto me to ſee our Church in her ruines? can I repine at that double honour you would get, in ruling well, as in labouring in the Goſpel?

No, it is the unwarrantableneſſe in Scripture, the unſuitableneſſe with mens Spirits, the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the effect; it is the deſire of peace, unity in the Church, and the taking away the root of our diviſions, eſpecially it is the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite account on the Miniſters Soul, the many grievous wounds, and perplexities of tender Conſciences, that have engaged my ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond was in <hi>Lu.</hi> 5. where Chriſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſo many Publicans and ſinners at Table with him, gives us the reaſon, that he came to call them to repentance, that is, to convert them; and yet Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> ſays, <hi>What is this againſt them,</hi> Who will admit none unto Chriſts Table, unleſſe converted already? For his interpretation of <hi>I come not to call the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> he wrongs Chriſt to ſay,

For my part I can patiently bear with his tearms, of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Instability, Prejudice, Perverſion,</hi> ſo long as I find a complacency in my ſpirit, and comfort in this paſſage above moſt I have writ. Methinks I have ſome paſſages are not ſo fit for me, I can even mourn over them, that they ſeem too pious for the writer; but this is an Argument, may be my very own, an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that becomes ſuch a poor ſinner as I am; the very prevailing thing at the bottom of my ſoul, and not ſo much an Argument, as the very confeſſion of my heart. Indeed I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that this acknowledgement of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would have turned to my ſhame, but I have found it my peace, and whilſt I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119920:59"/>mine iniquity, my God I hope does forgive me, and anſwer my reproach. For when Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> tells me, I am proud, a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, a <hi>Corah,</hi> I can but turn to this place, and I hope I am not ſo. For my anſwer then to him, his error is open, in taking his Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal judging for warranted, which is the thing in queſtion. Tis true, men cannot bring this paſſage againſt the Magiſtrate, nor to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our cenſures which God has commanded in the Church, yet is it ſufficient, I hope, to make us take heed, and be very loath to ſet up any cenſures (as of viſible worthineſſe) which Chriſt has not commanded us. So that to cloze, as I ſaid at firſt, if this were once proved a precept of Chriſt, I would yield to Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> in every particle, but ſeeing men are aſſured there is no ſuch thing, it is in vain <hi>to conceive chaff and bring forth ſtubble,</hi> which his own <hi>breath</hi> ſerves but to <hi>conſume,</hi> while of all his particulars, he that is now ſo hot, <hi>ſhall not have a coal</hi> left him, <hi>to warm at, nor fire to ſit before it.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The whole Art Mr. <hi>H.</hi> profeſſes, is to be a humble follower of Ieſus Chriſt, who tells us of no <hi>medium</hi> here, while he divides all his gueſts (as I have ſaid) into the called and choſen, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.14. Which cloze be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought in unto this Parable, may happily ſerve both to check Mr. <hi>D.</hi> that will be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than his Lord, and help to direct us in the rule of our admiſſion. The ſervants can look but to the one, who are Saints by calling, as the Lord to the other, who are Saints by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I doubt not but if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> finds out one <hi>medium,</hi> there will be enough to find out more, for if ever there were any Sects or Schiſms in the Church, they run upon this ſame account, that they have found out the true <hi>medium</hi> as well as he. If we maintained our profeſſion, we might have kept out our diviſions, but in the yielding the one, we are loſt in the other. Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> words here are but vain, when we ſee
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119920:61"/>theſe ſad effects. There is a wound made in our very bowels, which the Church has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by her own ſons, while they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the occaſion of ſeparation from her. This is the whirlpool wherein ſhe loſes her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom as ſoon as ſhe has foſtered under her wings, and with long travels gotten but out of the ſhell, they preſently leave her; Even as thoſe Ducklings that are hatch'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Hen, let them but come once to ſee the waters, they regard not at all the cluckings of their Mother, but run themſelves in the depths of their own imaginations.</p>
               <p>P. ibid. <hi>Wee look at his rule of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, or profeſſion, as a very looſe principle &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And what does he think of Chriſts action, in admitting of <hi>Judas,</hi> was that a looſe action? and are the Scriptures looſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? what reaſon has he for this? <hi>Becauſe it will open a door for Infants, &amp;c.</hi> Alas, good man I, Is this it? and I pray what elſe? <hi>As alſo for the wicked, &amp;c.</hi> He ſhould ſay in plain terms, It is a looſe principle, becauſe it is not his principle, and then he had hit it.</p>
               <p>For his inſtance of children, which we have had now no leſſe than eight times over, merely out of penury, in having nothing elſe; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I may only anſwer him, with the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, when he took another a-bed with his Wife, that was extremely ill favoured, O mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man (ſays he) what neceſſity has brought thee hither? O poor Mr. <hi>Drake!</hi> what wretchedneſſe is this, that he ſhould have no other argument to make uſe of?
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119920:62"/>For his other inſtance, <hi>if profeſſion be Mr.</hi> H'<hi>s, ground, how dare he Excommunicate any Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed perſon, though most wicked?</hi> I anſwer, As the Prieſt durſt ſhut up the Leper from the whole Congregation; becauſe of Gods ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.13. Indeed if the Prieſt would have kept him from the Ordinances, when he was not to be kept from the Camp, he had no warrant for it. Though I dare not exclude any Church-member, <hi>in ſtatu quo,</hi> while his right is good, yet I hope I may, where he has forfeited that right, and is made no Church-member by Excommunication. Becauſe I muſt admit of him that is a profeſſor, therefore may not I exclude him, that is for the preſent in the ſtate of no profeſſor? It fares with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren here, as it does in their lands, it is not for want of a right, but want of a capacity, they do not enjoy it; but it fares with the Excommunicate, as in mens forfeiture of their Eſtates; Their whole right to it is loſt for the preſent, until there be a recovery by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>Page 74. <hi>Doth not Mr.</hi> H. <hi>know, a man may be habitually worthy, and yet not actually, &amp;c. Dia he never hear of Real and Viſible worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. &amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> For the former, I do know it is a good diſtinction, as applied to the Receivers, though I believe it no wayes concerns the rule of our admiſſion. But for the latter, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I have heard of the Viſible Church, Saints by calling, Profeſſors, &amp;c. but this <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible worthineſſe,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed there-from, I have not lightly read of, but in him, though

               <p>And now methinks I ſee many pious men, conſcious of their own uprightneſſe, as ſo many <hi>Iobes,</hi> ready to ſtand up and juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; behold therefore, I ſhall be as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Elihis, formed out of the Clay;</hi> I have heard you ſay we are innocent, our way is righteous; But where are your Scriptures? Where is any precept for it? or example in the Word? doth it ſeem good to you to put a yoak on the Brethren, when you are not ſure, it ſeemeth good alſo to the Holy Ghoſt? Is there any thing worthy all your labours, watchings and pious deſigns, that has not clear Authority from Chriſt? Or is there any ſuch thing, worthy our Churches troubles and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations? Have ye been ſo tender of your own conſciences, about ſome circumſtances at this Table formerly, that you ſhould not now leave the ſubſtance of the duty free unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? And have you in the iſſue found any ſuch fruits, and bleſſed effects, as you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in laying this foundation, whereof our ſpiritual enemy takes advantage to bring a burden upon our own Souls, perplexities to tender Conſciences, diſpleaſure on the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and accidental danger to us all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the door to our endleſſe ſeparations? <hi>How hath the Lord Covered the Daughter of</hi> Zion <hi>with a cloud, and caſt down from Heaven to Earth the beauty of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>Reproach,</hi> and Diviſion <hi>hath broken our hearts, wee looked for

The ſtrength of this truly rednced to its fountain, iſſues from Gods precept, and our duty, which, ſo long as they muſt ſtand, the queſtion may not need ſo great debate, whether we muſt obey rather, God, or man.</p>
               <p>There was <hi>no Nation</hi> like the Jews, <hi>unto whom the Lord gave his Statutes,</hi> ſayes <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> it was the whole people, the whole Church, to whom the Statutes were given; Amongſt theſe Statutes, they had the Paſſeover, which you may ſee to whom it belongs, Exod. 12.3. <hi>Speak unto all the Congregations;</hi> Mark it, is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119920:64"/>not here a general inſtitution, as of any other ordinance? ſo that the whole <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Church, or all the circumciſed, is the adequate ſubject (if I may uſe thoſe words) of this duty? Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with <hi>Numb</hi> 9.3. and God ſayes, he that did not keep it, ſhould be cut off. Will any man now imagine (unleſſe Mr. <hi>Drake</hi>) that none but the regenerate were to eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Turn then to the Goſpel, and do we not likewiſe find the Sacrament inſtituted thus for the whole Church? The Lords words are, <hi>Doe this, Drink ye all of it,</hi> a ſtanding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to all the Twelve, as repreſentatives of the Vniverſal Church, as viſible, while <hi>Iudas</hi> is amongſt them; and it is expreſt, <hi>They all drank of it.

Again 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. you have the whole inſtitution repeated, and enjoyned till Chriſt come, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. And then <hi>ver.</hi> 33. he concludes directly thus, <hi>When you come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eat, tarry for one another.</hi> He ſpeaks, no doubt, unto the perſons he reproves, which we may ſee how vicious they were, and yet their comming he holds to be good, <hi>that must still be done,</hi> but directs them to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better there, which likewiſe <hi>ought not to be left undone.</hi> One would never think it ſhould have needed to come under proof, that this is a duty belonging in general to the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119920:64"/>Church, or that any ſhould hold, that it is a precept onely for the regenerate and Elect, if we did but conſider that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is ſo far from making diſtinction of theſe <hi>Corinths</hi> at it, that he brings it in the Chapter before, as an ordinary privilege, without any diſpute, even as freely as the very <hi>Manna, and the rock, which rock was Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto this I will adde only thoſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. <hi>This is my covenant you ſhall keep, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man-child among you ſhall be circumciſed;</hi> from whence it appears, the condition and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Covenant is either inwardly in the grace, or out wardly, in the adminiſtration; If a man be not inwardly in covenant to keep it effectually in the grace, yet ſo long as he is externally in covenant, he muſt keep it ſtill in the adminiſtration, that is in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>It is therefore, as I am afraid, very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to hold with Mr <hi>D.</hi> (let the pious judge between us) that <hi>it is onely the regenerate</hi> (for ſo he ſpeaks it) <hi>not every mans duty to receive;</hi> for this opens a door unto neglect, making mans impotency, a ſufficient reaſon to nullifie Gods precept, and to juſtifie one ſinne with another. I ſhall therefore here produce you Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> (for we muſt be plain herein) in his Caſes of Conſcience, whoſe authority I hope will go, he layes down theſe three rules.</p>
               <p>1: <hi>Every man of years living in the Church, and being baptized, is bound in conſcience by Gods command, Take, Eat, Doe ye this, to uſe the Lords Supper.</hi> You ſee here Church
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119920:65"/>memberſhip is the rule this Eminent man went by, and yet I hope was not one of the wicked, for all Mr. <hi>D's</hi> cenſure.2. <hi>Every man is to receive it often,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. <hi>conſidering it is nothing but the ſhewing the Lords death.</hi> He comes up to our very ground herein, as a viſible Goſpel.3. <hi>Every man is to receive, and uſe the Lords Supper, according to the laudable custom of his own Church, &amp;c.</hi> Nothing can be more full and honeſt. Indeed it is true, if a man live in any known ſin, he ought to repent before he come, he muſt come, and come worthy, he muſt come worthily, yet he muſt come, whether he be regenerate or unregenerate, he muſt obey ſtill; our neceſſity of ſinning cannot evacuate Chriſts authority, or mans duty. <hi>When an Action hath evil in its own ſubſtance, it is to be omitted; but when the Action is of its ſelf the matter of a precept, and ſo hath evil externally caſt on it by the Agent that doth it, here the Action is not to be omitted, but the Agent to be reformed.</hi>

The Word it ſelf, or covenant, is applicable to all, in the whole parts of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon its own terms, that is, conditionally.4. If this will not ſerve, Take but the language of the Covenant aright, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16.

1. His inſtances are <hi>ipſo jure</hi> Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.2. As Chriſt ſays, <hi>Doe this, Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Put away from you ſuch a perſon.</hi> We do not deny from Chriſts univerſal, <hi>Pauls</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.3. Though there is no occaſion that may make us commit a ſinne, yet are there many occaſions ſometimes of forbearing a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. A man may leave his gift at the altar, and go and be reconciled, but he muſt not take away his gift from the altar: The buſineſſe may be deferred, that muſt not be wholly left undone. If I know my brother evil, I think I may admoniſh him to repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and give him inſtructions of preparing himſelf better againſt next Sacrament, ſo long as I do but bind the obligation more on him; but if I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him upon ſuch reaſons as will wholly keep
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119920:66"/>him away, my adviſe is evil. Affirmative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts do bind univerſally, as well as Negative, but not <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> againſt all occaſions. I may in prudence, I think, adviſe my brother of ſuch an occaſion, for the advantage of his ſoul; but if I tell him it is not his duty, I make my ſelf Lord over Gods command. As the Church has alwayes attributed much unto prudence in the ordering this ſolemnity, eſpecially as to her more ſeldom and frequent adminiſtring, ſo may her Members happily take ſome example, as to their receiving. Forbearance on neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary (<hi>Numb.</hi> 9.10.) or pious grounds (<hi>Matt.</hi> 5.23.) reaches but to the <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> and may be lawfull; but for to hold, it is not a mans duty while unregenerate, this reaches the <hi>ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and looſes the bands of Gods command. Let this zealous man take heed, it be not laid to his charge.</p>
               <p>I will adde, If the man be careleſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not his comming, but being conſcious of his evil life, he thinks he ſhall eat his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo layes it by, which is the caſe of thouſands, I think we are here to ſet our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt ſuch, and to let them know, that it is not mans wickedneſſe can void or annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the authority of Chriſt: ſo that they are ſtill for to come, and the obligation lies on them, to apply the Covenant for their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. O my vile ſoul! why doeſt thou fly? This ſhews the guilt that is on thy conſcience, and wouldſt thou hide thine own eys from it? Come man, and ſee what thou haſt done; Here is Chriſts blood, which thou doſt ſhed with thy tranſgreſſions, and will not this melt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119920:66"/>thee? See how the corps doth as it were bleed at the preſence of the Murderer, and will it not melt thee? if it does not, it ſhall riſe up againſt thee. Behold here is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to thee eternal condemnation, unleſſe thou repenteſt, and ſincerely comeſt in to Ieſus Chriſt; Lay it well to heart, man, and think on it, there is no way beſides left thee for to eſcape it.</p>
               <p>Pag. <hi>ibid.</hi> He grants, though an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man ſins in all his duties, yet muſt he do them; But ſayes, <hi>There is not</hi> par ratio <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to receiving,</hi>
1. <hi>Becauſe it is not his duty,</hi>2. <hi>It cannot convert him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The former of theſe I have ſpoken to all this while, and ſhall thus enforce it: If the Sacrament be not the duty of an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, then muſt regeneration be a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification required in the precept, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to receiving, and ſo be eſſentially antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Sacraments; but regeneration is not eſſentially antecedent to the Sacraments. For
1. Then Baptiſm was not adminiſtred validly, and according to rule to many by the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.66. with <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.30.2. Then ſuch as were baptized before they were regenerate, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they came to be afterwards regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, were to be baptized again, becauſe their former baptiſm had not its eſſentials.3. Then can no man adminiſter either Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any but himſelf, for he cannot act in faith, ſeeing he is not ſure others have the eſſentials.4. Then can no doubting Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an himſelf receive, for he cannot act in faith
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119920:67"/>ſo long as he is not fully perſwaded of his own regeneration. The truth is then, though regeneration is a qualification neceſſary to the receiver, in regard of other ends, to wit, for the obtaining the entire benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſealed, yet not abſolutely neceſſary to receiving; Even as ſaving faith is neceſſary to the hearers of the Word, for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the effectual benefit of ſalvation, yet not abſolutely pre-requiſite to hearing, for faith may come by it. If it be an evil to ſet up our poſts with Gods poſts, what is it to remove Gods poſts, to ſet up our own? The Lord Ieſus ſays plainly, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> but Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſays No, <hi>It is not every mans duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond follows neceſſarily upon this, if it be every Church members duty of age, as Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and Divines commonly tell us, then it may tend to his good, as ſure as all Gods Commandements are good; and if it does him not good, it will be his ſin. For my part I am very ſorry to ſee how men for the ſake of this are forc'd upon it, to deny the other. When Chriſt ſays, <hi>Believe,</hi> there goes a power with his precept, as when he ſaid, <hi>Lazarus, Come forth;</hi> Elſe it were vain for us Miniſters to act, that are but ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then inſtruments. And ſhall Chriſt ſay, <hi>Take,</hi> and we make nothing of it? Is this it, men ſo earneſtly contend for, to make the word of Chriſt an empty word, as if it could not quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us? Alas Sirs! this is nothing but meer diſtruſt. A pious ſoul may even bleed to ſee his Saviours command laid waſt, becauſe we have ſo little faith in it. Chriſt is not a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119920:67"/>of the letter, which kils, but of the Spirit, which he conveys through his commands. The good Lord pardon, and help in us, this great evil of unbelief. And as for all the injuries this man out of his zeal has done unto me, Accept thou now, O God, from a melted heart, and wet eyes, this poor prayer of mine for him, that his own bitter words may not ſink ſo heavy on his ſoul, as they have on mine, when he comes to ſee how much he has done amiſſe.</p>

               <p>There is therefore a doing good or evil, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Simply,</hi> in regard of the matter of Gods precept; or <hi>Relatively,</hi> in regard of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it to its end, as it comes under the condition of the Covenant, whereby we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect life: In the firſt ſenſe, a man though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate may do well, and <hi>that which is right in Gods eyes,</hi> and be rewarded for it, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 10.30. yet ſins in the ſecond.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In thoſe words of mine, <q>Let men on one ſide anſwer, Let ſome of our other, &amp;c.</q> I muſt confeſſe they fell from me at firſt without the leaſt thought of Engagement. I know that every one is not fit to take up the Gantlet for truth, and I am one, as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſays truly, that <hi>am not yet ſcarce out of the ſhell of learning, or Divinity;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let not the hoſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> come out, <hi>to ſeek a fleae, or hunt a partridge upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the one ſide, I think our difference lies only about the Church, for as for their own Members, they ſcruple not at a Free-admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no more than I, and whether they turn away any before Excommunication, I cannot ſay, but gueſſe ſo. So that if there be ſcruples among themſelves, they that are humble, may make ſome uſe of me, they that are not, need not be offended, ſeeing Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tels them, <hi>they are beholding to me, for my too favourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:119920:68"/>
               <p>For the other ſide, (<hi>p.</hi> 80.81.) My queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to ſome, and it may be but few of them, <q>How they can baptize the children, (as Members of the viſible Church, being born of Chriſtian parents) and yet turn away their parents from the Sacraments?</q> I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> has ſaid here, <hi>p.</hi> 82, 83, 84. at the very largeſt for Infant-baptiſm, ſeeing as to my queſtion it falls beſide it. For if any will ſay, they do not baptize their Children, as born of Chriſtian parents, but <hi>by ſtipulation of others, or upon account of</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I ſay nothing againſt them, I wiſh it may be maintained; but as for thoſe who never took notice or not approved of any other ground of their Baptiſm, but as they are immediatly born Chriſtians of ſuch as viſibly profeſſe Chriſt, according to my terms; The right which the parents derive upon their children, unto Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, muſt be acknowledged to be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the Sacrament; They cannot give, but what they have. So that, unleſſe there be a manifeſt impediment to retrench that right, or the preſent enjoyment of it, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, Diſtraction, or Infection, their Church-memberſhip is ſufficient, and the argument valid, from the one to the other.</p>
               <p>Againſt this <hi>p.</hi> 81. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> brings in the old buſineſſe again, which is now about ten times, with a ſecond thing like it; And <hi>p.</hi> 85, 86, 87. (for that which is between, <hi>p.</hi> 82, 83. 84. I wiſh it may paſſe) he has 4 particulars more, the ſubſtance of the whole comes unto this, That the parents muſt have a farther
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119920:69"/>right to ſhew, than what they have common with their child unto this Ordinance. And here indeed lies the very point of our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I hold it is Church-memberſhip (where there is none of our former yielded impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) that gives an immediate outward right unto the Sacrament; He holds, A man muſt be firſt tryed if he be viſibly worthy, and it is that alone can give him admiſſion. For the one now, look over Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> and you ſhall find ſtill whenſoever he falls upon this thing, he has nothing againſt it, but that ſilly reaſon (from the untelligent) ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; Had he any thing elſe, would it not be alleged? and has he nothing elſe, and will you be captivated? For the other, look over the Scripture; This is the thing lies on him to prove, and ſee if he can produce you any precept of God for it; if he has none, will his own word goe? While he has ſo little againſt us, and no Text for himſelf, <hi>his skirts are diſcovered, and heels made bare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the prudent judge, If our argument from Church-memberſhip is even the chief and moſt ſolid ground upon which we do bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize our Children, as the <hi>Iews,</hi> by being born <hi>Iews,</hi> had a right to Circumciſion, although we cannot lightly find in Scripture that any were admitted without a profeſſion of faith unto Baptiſm; what weakneſſe ſhall we bring on our ſelves, if the ſame thing ſhall not be held ſufficient (without a known cauſe) unto the Sacrament, whereunto we find no confeſſion any where required, but as ſoon as they were once Church-members, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119920:69"/>42. this fellowſhip immediately gave them a privilege to it?</p>
               <p>The Sacraments ſerve for two things, for our faith towards God, and profeſſion one with another; Though our Church-members doe not all come with that faith, whereby they ſhould receive the effectual benefits of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, yet do I not ſee how they can be ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily debarr'd their profeſſion of Chriſtianity, in oppoſition to all other Religions, as the <hi>Iews</hi> did often, freely, and univerſally, enter into Covenant with the true God.</p>
               <p>P. 87, 88, 89. Hee brings in my argument of Chriſtian liberty, from <hi>Ordinances of men, Col.</hi> 2.18, 19, 20. which muſt not be ſuffered to creep into the <hi>ſeat of God,</hi> as <hi>neceſſary</hi> to our worſhip. And this, I take it, does prevail much with many that fear God.</p>
               <p>Againſt this he ſays 4 things, 1. <hi>Let the Readers take notice, that in Mr.</hi> Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey's <hi>judgement, the putting a bar to Free-admiſſion, is an humane, not divine Ordinance, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I doubt not but they will take notice that I doe willingly yield to all our known Barrs (under the Unintelligent, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate) the Church has allowed; but am fully perſwaded, that this barre Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would ſet up otherwiſe, has no foundation in the Scriptures, and muſt wiſh him to take heed, that while he ſets up his <hi>viſible worthineſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trial,</hi> as the rule of our admiſſion, which Chriſt has not ſet up, his own words <hi>(We like not the preſſing of humane inventions upon the conſcience, especially in Divine worſhip)</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:119920:70"/>do not riſe up, and fly upon him. I pray God give him a ſight, how he profeſſedly maintains, what he diſlikes, and of thoſe ſad evils his opinion has done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He asks, <hi>By what Scripture and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence I can keep off Infants, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted? and he will by the ſame exclude all perſons viſibly unworthy, or elſe he will be of my Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Seeing he ſays ſo, I will expreſſe my ſelf once more. My ground is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28, 29. Upon this ground I draw this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, That thoſe whoſe duty it is not to Examine themſelves, and get knowledge to diſcern the Lords body, are not to come; Such are all Infants, and the Diſtracted, it being <hi>naturally</hi> impoſſible. But can Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> now ſay the like here? That it is not the duty of all viſibly unworthy, to get knowledge, and examine themſelves, that ſo they may come? Dare he ſay ſo? If he dare not, I hope he will perform his promiſe, and yield to the truth. Beſides, as I have ſaid, they that have an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent capacity may receive ſome good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions by it, (and the more weak, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are more affectionate) but as for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and the Diſtracted, we know ſigns can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have any real work on them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſays, <hi>If his bar were only prudential, I ſhould do better to ſubmit, than diſpute againſt it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If I ſhould do <hi>the Church ſervice,</hi> in ſubmitting to this way only as humane, then ſhall I do God ſervice, to oppoſe it as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119920:70"/>and not let it ſit in his ſeat, as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary antecedent to this Ordinance. And I doubt not but Ieſus Chriſt, that has ſhed his moſt precious blood to purchaſe our liberty, will be jealous over it, and not ſuffer our Conſciences to become the ſervants of men, nor yet theſe pious men to become ſervants to themſelves. Indeed I know we have good diſtinctions here, as to the obeying of men, between the obedience of the outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and that <hi>ſimpliciter, neceſſitate conſequentis, &amp; ex hypotheſi, neceſſitate conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentiae,</hi> but I fear what in it ſelf may be prudent, the ſad effects will make other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>

When Chriſt ſays <hi>Do this,</hi> He doubts not to ſay, <hi>It is not a general rule for us.</hi> When Chriſt ſays, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> He ſays, It is not the unregenerates (that is, the moſt of mens) duty.

His own confeſſion is this, <hi>By a particular forewarning the Miniſter may clear his own ſoul, I conceive, where no Government is ſetled, &amp;c.</hi> And do not I ſuppoſe we have no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Miniſter forewarn all (though as to particular caſes there muſt go much prudence, and I hold no neceſſity) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Conſcience? and therefore why ſhould he lay ſuch vile expreſſions on me, for what he allows? Does he ſay, he may clear his ſoul, and may not I ſay, he is innocent?
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119920:74"/>Should I return now, no mortal man can ſay he is clear, and ſo fall upon him in his looſe terms about juſtifying himſelf, which he does often, would not every one ſee how weak were that cauſe has need of ſuch ſupportments? and would it not render me flat to thoſe that fear God? No, I ſhall rather bleſſe God for what is yielded, and think it worth both our labours, (as it was a main ſcope of mine) if this be but ſatisfied. I ſhall reverence the care, zeal, and pains, of Mr. <hi>D.</hi> wherein (he ſays) he does ſo far <hi>exceed me, in fitting all ſorts by examination, counſel, and prayer;</hi> yet muſt not approve his ground, on which he does it. If he will tell his people, As you are Church-members, I cannot deny communion with you, though in Chriſtian prudence only, I would humbly thus and thus adviſe you; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his piety, Let our Conſciences be free, Let our needleſſe ſcruples, our wounds, and terrors be healed, and I have done. Let the Sacrament be returned, like the Ark, again, unto our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and I ſhall be content, to have the new Cart that brings it, to be cloven into Wood, and the two Kine, offered with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a ſacrifice unto God.</p>

               <p>For <hi>Judas,</hi> it is already anſwered. For, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. it is manifeſt, after St. <hi>Paul</hi> has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd the <hi>Corinths</hi> of their unworthineſſe, yet their <hi>coming together</hi> he approves, and

I ſay, a man muſt examine himſelf, and ſo Eat, he muſt do both, I joyn them. He ſays the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate muſt examine himſelf, and ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, He ſeparates them. Nay he ſays, he muſt be preſent too, but not Eat, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven another Schiſm in the actions. His words then, <hi>Mr.</hi> H. <hi>ſays, let a man Eat though he does not examine himſelf,</hi> are a ſlander. I place very much on this. There are two things I hold an unregenerate Chriſtian is ſtill to do, to examine himſelf and to wait; to wait, and to examine himſelf. He muſt conſider his own condition that he may pray according to it, when he has prayed and goes about his duty, he muſt examine ſtill, what influence God has on him by it. He muſt likewiſe, when he comes to hear, and eſpecially to receive, try his own heart, that he may apply the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, according to his eſtate, and when he has done, he muſt look over his ſoul ſtill, what he has gained in waiting on God. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I do here in the name of Chriſt, as you look for good at his ordinance, commend to you this duty, and if you ſhall dare to come with careleſſe hearts, and ſecure ſpirits, may the terrors of eating and drinking your damnation ſeize upon you, and frighten you from the danger, into the arms of repentance, and boſom of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:119920:75"/>
               <p>For the good of comming, he objects <hi>p.</hi> 98, 99. <hi>The Sacrament must not be attended on as the word, in order to converſion, but edification, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We muſt not receive this doctrine without Scripture, which will wholly diſ-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple this Ordinance, though I think his own diſtinction may ſerve the truth, if ordered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, ſeeing the word Edifying, as in our fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe, ſo ordinarily in Scripture, is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted in common to the viſible Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3, 4. There are therefore (though this might have been reſpited yet to its place) two ends, unto which the Word is inſtituted, To convert the Nations unto the faith, and to Edifie ſuch as are brought in to the profeſſion of it. Now it is true, the Sacrament is inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted but for one of theſe ends; It is not to convert the Heathen, for the Word is no ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Word unto them, but it is to edifie the Church, wherein the moſt being ſuch as are not yet effectually wrought upon, as it tends to Edifie them, it muſt be a help or means to their regeneration. And thus ſhall his <hi>ſtrong hold become as a forſaken bough, and uppermost branch,</hi> unto which, we may climb up by his own terms, and not leave on it, ſo much <hi>as the ſhaking of an Olive tree, or as the gleaning Gapes, when the Vintage is done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the evil of Omiſſion, <hi>p.</hi> 100. he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes between a not receiving, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting; which may be allowed, I think, on a juſt occaſion, ſo long as we reſolve on better preparation againſt the next Sacrament; But otherwiſe, it is a poor anſwer to my inſtance
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119920:76"/>of the Paſſeover, where the bare omiſſion of <hi>not bringing an offering in the appointed ſeaſon,</hi> which in the forbearance, was allowed to none, but for a Moneth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.13. was ſuch a ſinne as did endanger them to be cut off. His exceptions <hi>p.</hi> 101. againſt the Parable, <hi>Matt:</hi> 22. are vain things; Thoſe that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſervants, were a part of them that were invited, and not to be oppoſed, for the contempt of the feaſt is the main buſineſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as appears by <hi>Lu.</hi> 14. where nothing elſe is mentioned. But the main queſtion (for ſo far the Parable may reach) is, whether they that refuſe to come into Gods Ordinances, (all which I allow it concerns, as well as this) are not unworthy, <hi>v.</hi> 8. and in danger to be deſtroyed? And then whether it be better for an unregenerate Chriſtian to come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as preparedly as he can, or wholly to omit it? and I think we are ſufficiently inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by all other duties, which is the greater ſin, to ſail only in the manner, or to leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done the matter alſo. <hi>Let the briars and thorns be ſet together in battel, the fire ſhall paſſe through them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 102. <hi>In oppoſition to Mr.</hi> H. <hi>it is neither a certain duty on the Miniſters part to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all, nor on the peoples part, for all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>D.</hi> take heed how he is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through oppoſition, leſt in oppoſing Mr. <hi>Humfrey,</hi> he directly oppoſes the command of Chriſt. He grants, <hi>p.</hi> 47. That where there is no government ſetled, the Miniſter by a due forewarning may clear his ſoul, but how ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119920:76"/>does he reverſe this here, and wrap him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in a fatal cloud? for if it be not his duty, it muſt be his ſin, there is no <hi>medium</hi> for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. Let us therefore here ſteel our ſelves, that in doing both, we do as we ought, without making his conſcience (as to the particulars, <hi>de facto</hi>) a rule of ours. For his diſtinction of <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and immediately,</hi> he ſhould have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born the wound, and ſaved his ſalve; for there is none that denies, but that every man is to examine himſelf, and prepare, as well as come. But whereas he holds, that though a man ſhould examine and prepare himſelf (ſuppoſe as well as he can) yet if they judge him not viſibly worthy, he muſt not be admitted, and if he judges not himſelf really worthy, for his own part yet, he muſt not eat, he has <hi>ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a line:</hi> of diviſion over the Church, <hi>a plummet</hi> of lead on weak conſciences, and <hi>wiped</hi> the Sacrament, <hi>as a man wipeth a diſh, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it, and turning it upſide down in wiping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame page he tels us, <hi>They do not keep away any for fear of accidental ſcandal, though others do, he patrons not;</hi> and yet in the next, he ſays, <hi>I charge them with doing evil, that good may come of it, whoſe damnation</hi> (that is, I take it, diſallowance) <hi>is juſt, Rom.</hi> 3.8. And here, that the words may ſeem harſh, he produces them without the Text, and will have it in a Rhetorical way, when I barely take them as they are; and becauſe this is not enough, he frames an interpretation (by <hi>ſuſpending, &amp;c.</hi>) of his own; So that I muſt needs be made guilty of cenſuring them, when he confeſſes, it does not concern them. And now, for all this
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119920:77"/>falſe accuſation, ſhall I, inſtead of returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evil to him, humbly ſatisfie him, that as for any bitter ſpirit in quoting that text, God knows I am innocent, and may even patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. he <hi>may well forgive me this wrong,</hi> for I never intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in it. But as for his own cenſoriouſneſſe, it is ſuch, as makes his very mercies to be wounds, and his forgiveneſſes themſelves, need to be forgiven.</p>
               <p>He is pleaſed here to write a book againſt me, which is nothing almoſt but revilings, and when he has done me all the injuries he can, that never offended him, he proceeds to <hi>forgive me, and deſires God to free Mr.</hi> H <hi>from all that guilt,</hi> and miſchief, he would bring on me. This is his kindneſſe to me a ſtranger, I thank him; And truly met hinks my ſoul is ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for fear I ſhould offend any of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I do even accept of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ah Lord I Can ſpite go to prayer? Let me be ſpited, if I be forgiven. While he ſeems to hold up his hands to pray for me, it is to ſtrike me with them, and having already laid me in the duſt, he does but herein, as it were, <hi>kneel</hi> upon me to keep me down. Yet will I heartily joyn with him, in beſeeching the Lord to pardon my failings, to pity my weakneſſes, and to keep his Church, if I do erre, from any hurt by it. <hi>Let the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſmite me, and it ſhall be a balm; yea, let him reprove me</hi> where I do amiſſe, <hi>and it ſhall be an Oyl;</hi> but <hi>Let not the foot of pride come at me. Behold I am vile, I will lay my hand on my mouth, Once have I ſpoken, and I will not anſwer, twice have I ſpoken, but will proceed no
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119920:77"/>farther.</hi> Nevertheleſſe if truth ſhall be found with me, let not any diſdain it, though I am nothing, for I do even wholly herein look ſo upon my ſelf, and depend on God for it, with as much fear and trembling as my heart can hold; and I find thoſe impreſſions I ſometimes receive in my addreſſes unto him, does carry me on, to hope for good, and venture the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue upon him. <hi>Look on me, O Lord, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all my ſins.

               <p>Page 103. He comes to the end of my firſt Sermon, and as he would have the Reader ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me, <hi>p.</hi> 99. to leave ſome ſcruple about the unregenerates receiving as a pledge, but obſerves not himſelf what is added, <q>Which nevertheleſſe on the Miniſters part, as offer'd on condition, is not hard.</q> So likewiſe here he quotes theſe words, <q>I give you not my reaſons by the heap</q>, but by the weight, but leaves out what follows, <q>I humbly commit them to you</q>, which takes off the aſperſion.

               <p>The firſt Objection was about Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being a point to be combated by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, I ſhall willingly ſubmit to be inſtructed by others. There are three falſe ſurmiſes here, I only endeavoured to remove (according to my maine end herein) as apt to trouble tender Conſciences; the firſt was, <q>
                     <hi>That Excommunication is meerly in reference to the Sacrament,</hi>
                  </q> whereas it is a cenſure, or puniſhment of <hi>binding the ſins of men on earth,</hi> by caſting them out from the Church, and Chriſt externally, untill they repent. It is true indeed, when men are caſt out from Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in generall, that they are debarred from the Sacrament, which is a token or pledge thereof, (when other Ordinances are more diſputable) yet
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119920:79"/>is it the ſtate and relation men have to the Church outwardly, and Chriſt, as viſible Members, that Excommunication reſpects, from which while they are excluded, their ſins are accordingly (and no otherwiſe) bound and retained, (becauſe there is no remiſſion out of the Church, or without Chriſt: the viſible herein <hi>(Clave non errante)</hi> preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the inviſible) as they are looſed by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in againe through repentance. And hence, I take it, was the Apoſtles ſhaking off the duſt of their feet againſt thoſe that received not their Doctrin of that dreadfull importance, as ſignifying their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admiſſion into this relation.</p>
               <p>Concerning this, Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> firſt gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his practiſe, and then layes downe three particulars for the bill of his account, <hi>p.</hi> 105, 106. I ſhall ſay nothing, but it may be faire, yet will not be taken, unleſſe we could finde the Scripture had ſet her hand unto it; we cannot receive Maſter Drakes <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as we doe <hi>Moſes,</hi> without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. For his particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He tels us; Maſter <hi>H. omits the maine end of Church cenſure, which is the amendment of the party, &amp;c.</hi> Anſ. I wonder at this, ſeeing but juſt over the leafe, as ſoon as it is to my purpoſe, I doe expreſly tell him, the end is to bring the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to repentance. It is reported of St. <hi>Albans</hi> Executioner, that as ſoone as he had ſtrucke the blow, his eyes dropt out (as teares) at the fact he had done; the ſame fate is befallen Mr. <hi>Drake,</hi> while he is ſo cruel, many times, in his cenſure to me, he cannot ſee a leafe before him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He would perſwade us, That <hi>Church Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are extendible to ignorant perſons, and every wilfull ſinner. Anſ.</hi> The Scripture extends
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119920:79"/>them I think to none but the more notorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate offendors; for my part, I dare not binde ſuch a heavie burden on the Conſciences of others, which I durſt not touch with my little finger. It is a thing indeed to be wiſht, that the ignorant bee brought to Catechiſme and Inſtruction, the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to reproofe and admonition, but not ſo ſlightly to be cenſured, or kept from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Were this Doctrine ſtrictly followed, it would ſoone leave us without Church-Members, and while it would thus ſcatter our Flocks, either Maſter <hi>Drakes</hi> wits are going a wool gathering, or elſe ours muſt all be ſet a gathering Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>He challenges all the World to ſhew him proofe, that perſons excommunicate may not be preſent at any publick Ordinance, &amp;c.

               <p>Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> upon this text tels us over and over, that Blaſphemers, Hereticks, obſtinate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp;c. <hi>Are to be barred from the Word till they repent.</hi> The meaning of Chriſt is, ſayes he, <hi>If any be openly convicted, &amp;c. to ſuch publiſh not my word;</hi> and eſpecially concerning the point, how farre the cenſure of the Church does extend, <hi>It extends</hi> (he tels us) <hi>to the debarring ſuch in the uſe of the Ministry in the Word, Prayer, and Sacraments; indeed if the party be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate for ſome particular Crime, &amp;c. then, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be excluded from communion with him, in the Sacraments, and Prayer</hi> (marke that) <hi>yet may he be admitted to hearing the Word, to help him to repent, which is the end of all Church Cenſures.</hi> So that it is ſtrange Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſhould faſten here a new Light on me, when himſelfe is ſo ſingularly oppoſite to the practiſe of the Church.</p>
               <p>Upon this account I muſt confeſſe, it hath been my opinion, that the Excommunicate being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Church ſociety in generall, it is by way of mitigation (as I expreſſed in thoſe few words I let fall about it, <hi>p.</hi> 13.) that they are permitted at one Ordinance, when kept from others; but I deſire not here to be aſſertive, for though I doubt not but Excommunication does referre to Church-Communion in generall, or Church-memberſhip, yet doe I conceive Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> (or <hi>Eraſt us</hi>) reaſon is not ſo eaſily to be waved, that Heathens may be preſent at the Word, if not other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. I could be willing therefore to compound this matter with one diſtinction. Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is either real, or relative; I ſhall leave it to him
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119920:80"/>that will to diſpute with Mr. <hi>D.</hi> how the Church can exclude the excommunicate really from being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentat the Word, and Prayer; and it ſhall ſuffice me that they are excluded relatively however, from all priviledges, ſo that though they may be preſent as Heathen, yet are they cut off from all their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in them, ſtill as members.</p>
               <p>That which we admit Heathen to in receiving them into the Church, I thinke we caſt them out from, in excommunicating them; now we admit men directly into Church-Society in generall, or Memberſhip, whereby they are put in a ſtate or relation unto Chriſt, and conſequently to all his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, with a difference of priviledge from the world, (and as they were at them before) that they belong now to them, as externally in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, redeemed, ſanctified; in a word, as in communion with the Head and Body, whereof the Sacrament is a pledge, unto which they cannot therefore be admitted; until they are in, nor Juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically debarred, until they are put out of that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The difference then between Mr. <hi>D.</hi> and me lyes not about the other Ordinances, for I wil ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (not grant) that Excommunication does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre a man really (by neceſſary conſequence) on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actual receiving, yet is his errour ſtil the ſame; that whereas I hold a man is to be debarred this actual receiving by Excommunication, he wil have him to be debarred without it. I hold, it is Church-memberſhip gives a man admiſſion, and ſutably Excommunication excludes him. Hee holds, it is viſible worthineſſe upon trial can only admit him, and conſequently ſets up a cenſure ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his rule (neither of which are in Scripture) to exclude him without Excommunication; ſo that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119920:81"/>a man is ſtil a Church-member, and in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in general, yet muſt not be allowed the token of that Communion; he is ſtil externally in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and yet muſt be debarred the external Seal thereof in the body, and muſt not partake of the body; this is a Riddle.</p>
               <p>Where the Sins of men are not bound, or retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there is no Church-cenſure, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Jo.</hi> 20.23. but it is not excluding men from the Sacrament that does bind or retaine their ſins, but the excluding them from the Church, and ſo rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively from all its benefits; and therefore ſuſpenſion without Excommunication, or Diſmemberſhip, is no Church-cenſure, and ought not to wrong that ſolemne inſtitution.</p>
               <p>We ſhal cleare this by the manifeſt phraſes of Excommunication, <hi>I will give thee the keyes of the kingdome of heaven, Matth.</hi> 16.19. That is, of the Church, to admit in, and ſhut out of it; there is no cenſure of the Keyes, without excluſion from the Church, whatſoever degrees you make after; <hi>Let him be to thee as a heathen, Matth.</hi> 18.17. that is apparently, as no Church-member, this Mr. <hi>D.</hi> grants; from whence that interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is pertinent, when thou haſt uſed all theſe Chriſtian meanes, thou mayeſt implead him at the Law, which elſe was not fit for a fellow member, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <gap reason="foreign">

One may thinke this cenſure excluded from all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, but the Learned reduce it to <hi>Nidui,</hi> which kept them off only foure paces, though they might be preſent, yet this diſtance ſtil noted their ſeparation, as Church-members, <hi>To deliver ſuch a

But in regard of this ſtate of Memberſhip, or relative condition, <hi>Purge out the leaven,</hi> that is, from being a part or member of the lump, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and <hi>put away from among your ſelves</hi> ſuch a perſon, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>It is therefore a very fond conceit of Mr. <hi>D.</hi> to make two degrees of Excommunication beneath
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119920:82"/>Diſ-memberſhip; that is, two degrees of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men out of the Church, before they are put out of the Church; two degrees of hanging, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore execution.

                  </gap>; as it is one thing <hi>eſſe cum Chriſto,</hi> 1 Phil. 23. and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Chriſtum eſſe cum nobis,</hi> Matth. 28.20. ſo is it one thing to with-draw our ſelves from ſuch a man, and another to remove ſuch a man from us; the one phraſe only (I thinke) reſpects Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, not the other, which is in theſe two texts.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:119920:82"/>If Mr. <hi>D.</hi> object, If we may not eat with them at our ordinary table, then much leſſe at this ſacred Table;
1 I return; If we may not keep company with them at our owne table, then wee may not keep company with them at this Table; but this he will ſay wil not hold, for they may all be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; no more, I ſay, will the other.2 Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is either neceſſary, or arbitrary, we are to avoid ſuch in arbitrary familiarity, but not in the neceſſary ſervice of God. The reaſon is plaine, becauſe one is our duty, and not the other.</p>
               <p>I pray ſee Page 107. <hi>I grant that by Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication they are made as Heathen and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, and are in</hi> ſtatu quo <hi>no members.</hi> Now how ſtrange is this, That while hee cannot deny the excommunicate are diſ-membred, hee ſhould keep ſuch a doe, to ſet up a cenſure which is no diſ-memberſhip, and make it a degree too of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which he confeſſes it is not. Thus while men will ſet up a rule of their owne for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, they are forced to make a cenſure of their owne for excluſion. <hi>And as the Partridge gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the young ſhe hath not brought forth,</hi> that is, by her calling gathereth others which forſake her, when they ſee ſhe is not their damme; ſo muſt this ſuſpenſion <hi>not gotten by right, leave them in the end,</hi> when it can finde no covert under the wings of Excommunication.</p>
               <p>The onely Argument that they here have, is from the greater to the leſſe; which while they urge thus, If the Church may exclude from all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, ſhe may from the Sacrament, hath ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething, but is a miſtake in the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for Excommunication refers directly to Church-memberſhip, and conſequentially onely to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119920:83"/>the Ordinances; ſo that a man muſt be put out of the Church, or elſe he is not legally put from the communion. Even as the Leper was not kept from the Camp, that he might be kept from publicke worſhip; but he was kept from commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in worſhip, becauſe hee was kept from the Campe, this being a neceſſary conſequent thereof. So is a man kept from the Sacrament, becauſe hee is excluded Church-memberſhip, being out of the body, he is not to have the communion of it. It were a wrong to have forbid the Leper at divine Service, when his right was good to abide in the Congregation; So is it a wrong to turne away a man from the Sacrament, while his right is good, as a member.</p>
               <p>Look on our gathered Churches, they are herein uniforme (If I miſtake them not) and deny not fellowſhip with a member, till they put him out of their Church; or to maintaine a conſonancy, me thinkes ſhould doe ſo; and ſhall wee that have the Scriptures to uphold our viſible Church againſt ſeparation, as it were yeeld our cauſe, when we dare not owne our members in communion? This is a breach that wil not be made up, by his reaſon a <hi>majori,</hi> becauſe the Magiſtrate may inflict a puniſhment, which is the greater, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law; therefore he may inflict a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the leſſe, not according to Law, or ſet up a new one to inflict by it; becauſe the Elders may execute a cenſure which is allowed in the Scripture, therefore they may make a leſſe, which is not in Scripture. The Judge himſelfe, that inſtead of death, inflicts burning, muſt yet do it according to Law, or his act is not good. I will not diſpute here of the kindes or degrees of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119920:83"/>thoſe three among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and foure among the <hi>Greeks</hi> are common; Nor what are the marks of diſtinction of ſuch degrees, whether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion <hi>really</hi> from the Sacrament, and prayer, may make a <hi>minor,</hi> and ſuſpenſion from them, and the word alſo, a <hi>major</hi> Excommunication; (for I doe thinke, when a man is <hi>Relatively</hi> deprived fellowſhip in general, the Church may uſe mitigation, or ſeverity to a <hi>reall</hi> permiſſion of him at ſome Ordinances (and ſo perhaps for civill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe) according to prudence for his edification, not deſtruction) or whether, as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> holds, <hi>Acts of Diſcipline, are no bars at all to acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, unleſſe actual receiving;</hi> and why that onely? but becauſe the Sacrament is the pledge of our Church-fellowſhip, which one being caſt out from, the other muſt follow: It ſhall ſuffice mee that Church-cenſure is putting out of the Church, and that ſuſpenſion is null, without diſ-memberſhip; Inſomuch, that if a <hi>Jew</hi> were under <hi>Nidui,</hi> which was their loweſt degree, if unabſolved, <hi>Godwin</hi> obſerves, his children might not bee circumciſed: and why not? but that they reckoned him no Church-member; Church-memberſhip being an undoubted ground of their circumciſion. I will conclude: ſeeing then Excommunication by the Scripture is referred ſtil unto Church-memberſhip, and not to the Sacrament, it is not viſible unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, or unfitneſſe thereunto, is the formall ground of cenſure, and conſequently, not ignorance, and every ſinne lived in. This is the point I deſire may be marked as the ſcope of this diſcourſe, that I ſay upon this, it is not to be viſibly unfit for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving (as ſome hold) but to be viſibly unworthy all Church-ſociety that infers an excommunication.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119920:84"/>God forbid, but we ſhould put adiſtinction between ſinnes, that ſtand not with ſincerity, and that ſtand not with publicke profeſſion; I doe not thinke the detection of a man living in any knowne ſinne that contradicts the one, ought to excommunicate him; but the open conviction of ſuch ſinnes, which are notoriouſly ſcandalous, and obſtinate, bringing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit on the Church, and contradicting the other. And as for the <hi>Antiqueriſt</hi> he quotes here of his ſide, ſo magnificently, and ſo often, Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> tels us, it is himſelfe. <hi>Let another man praiſe thee, and not thine owne mouth, a ſtranger, and not thine own lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond ſurmiſe I would remove was this, <q>
                     <hi>That Church-cenſures are only to keep the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances pure, eſpecially the Sacrament, lest it ſhould be defiled otherwiſe to the receivers.</hi>
                  </q> There are many precious Chriſtians herein made weake, which yet are not to be ſleighted with Mr. <hi>D.</hi> but tenderly to be ſatisfied; It is true, The Ordinances may be ſaid to be prophaned or defiled to a mans ſelfe, and therefore when a man is cenſured for a Swine or Dog, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſayes, he muſt be kept from them. But let not any pious ſoul think, the unworthineſſe of another can pollute him in doing his duty. This it ſeems was the old errour of the <hi>Novatians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For M. <hi>D.</hi> his exception here (Page 109.) where he yet agrees with me, they might have been ſpared;
1 <hi>We thinke</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the Ordinances are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed onely to thoſe who uſe them ſinfully.</hi>2 <hi>That perſons are defiled not by preſence with unworthy receivers, but by partaking in their ſinnes.</hi>3 <hi>They partake in their ſinnes that doe not their duty to reforme them, or keep them from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving otherwiſe.</hi>

               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:119920:84"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt of theſe, is good and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive. The ſecond likewiſe, if for preſence, he had put in receiving, elſe it is but ſuperſtitious. The third is much amiſſe, and equivocal; They partake of thoſe ſinnes they ſhould have reproved, and doe not, but not of any ſinne in their receiving, any more then in their hearing and praying. Such words as theſe are ſubject to do hurt, as if it were a duty ſimply to keep one another from Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and that this were the onely eminent peece of piety, when it is certainly our duty to excite, call, provoke them to, as counſel, fit, and prepare them for the attending all Ordinances.</p>
               <p>His next exceptions are at me for ſaying, that cenſures concerne not the admitted, but to reforme the offenders cenſured, &amp;c. For firſt, ſayes he, <hi>It concernes all Church members in their places to looke to it.</hi> Secondly, <hi>To keep them in awe, &amp;c.</hi> And, who doubts it? But then he ſayes, <hi>I contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict my ſelfe</hi> (which I muſt be ſure to doe, when he pleaſes) <hi>in that my owne ends <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, concerne the whole Congregation. Anſw.</hi> One may here ſee how eaſie it is to carp, and be fallacious; It is but taking a mans words <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter,</hi> when they are ſpoke <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> and it may be done; who cannot ſay as Mr. <hi>Drake,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition concernes the Admoniſher; Satisfaction the Satisfied; Example the warned; But how doe any of theſe ends concerne them as to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to their owne act of receiving thereof? There is none of them, I hope, intimate any farther guilt or pollution would accrew to them, if the party (I ſay in this act of receiving) were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. Indeed this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> he picks out, may infer a man guilty of thoſe ſinnes (in a ſenſe) he does not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119920:85"/>reprove and hinder; if he can, but as for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, that is a mans duty, if that prove a ſinne, it is not <hi>propter fieri,</hi> but accidentally; ſo that Church-members are not herein bound to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, but by their beſt counſels to be furtherers one of another in their comming; and if in prudence they ſometimes may adviſe them to forbear, it can be lawfull onely but upon that account which may proportionably reach unto all affirmative precepts. It is indeed the great fallacy here that miſ-leads many, when they plead our duty of <hi>watching over others, not partaking their ſins, to get the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cenſured,</hi> and the like, they wind it all in ſtil, in order to the Sacrament, as if they were to bee done meerly in reference to it, when as they are each of them diſtinct duties, and the neglect or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, is no ground, or hindrance of the other. They concerne us as Church-members, not <hi>quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Receivers.</p>
               <p>The third ſurmiſe was,  <q>
                     <hi>That there is ſome neer eſſential relation, between Excommunication, and the communion, as if it were a part of it:</hi> ſo groſſe are ſome conceirs, <hi>at leaſt ſuch a neceſſary antecedent, that they think they may not come to our Sacraments without it;</hi> which is all one, as if becauſe we have here no Juſtices, or Aſſize, they ſhould think it unlawful to follow their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To remove this, Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> joynes with mee (Page 110, 111.112, 113.) and ſhews the vanity, contradiction, abſurdity hereof, in termes ſuting the thing and himſelfe. Truly me thinks a man may bee very merry, to ſee how featly he would amaze people here, as if he did confute me, when he onely ſpeaks my part for me, and ſhews the

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is a pile of Buildings, faire, and coſtly, yet all is loſt by miſtaking the ground whereon he hath ſet it; for it is not viſible <hi>Reall</hi> worthineſſe upon tryall, but viſible <hi>Relative</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe (if I may ſo expreſſe it) or external Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Relation, gives a man right, and is the ground of admiſſion; ſo long as hee hath his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Baptiſme, and Memberſhip, you muſt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:119920:86"/>diſprove his right if you exclude him, and not hee prove any other.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I require nothing be intruded on us without Scripture; Here is a catalogue of Magiſterial Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but I pray, where are his proofs? what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath he for it? Its true, the Apoſtle admoniſhes 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Be ready alwayes to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you, of the reaſon of the Hope that is in you:</hi> But
1. What is that in order to the Sacrament?2. The place there does clearly ſpeak, as to the defence of our Faith in caſe of perſecution, and Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> triall is no <hi>Inquiſition.</hi>3. Hope is taken <hi>objectivè,</hi> for Chriſtian Doctrine; not <hi>ſubjectivè,</hi> for the Truth of Grace he would inquire into. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he urge it, as an office of common charity; doth all this follow upon it ſtreight? will he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently up and ride? Is there no more to be proved? This is right as ready, as the Schollar for his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he wanted onely Boots, and Spurs, a Cloak, a Horſe, Bridle and Saddle, for hee had gotten a Switch.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
1. One good proofe were better then many ſuch untoward ſpeeches.2. Our Saviour Chriſt I hope was of no ſuch Religion, yet did not he keep away <hi>Judas.</hi>3. Though we are to watch over, admoniſh, and bee keepers of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it is within the compaſſe of divine Precepts: But this precept, Keep thy neighbor from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, is to my beſt remembrance, none of the ten Commandements.4. The caſe is ſtill the ſame here as in other Ordinances, unleſſe you can ſhew me any difference put in Scripture.5. Thoſe the Church ought not to admit, ſay others upon this, we ought not to joyn with, and if the Miniſter neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects his duty, yet muſt we doe ours, and ſo they ſeparate from us. And therefore laſtly. I would have ſuch know how to diſtinguiſh between an action <hi>ſub genere entis,</hi> and <hi>ſub genere morum;</hi> we admit or allow none to receive unworthily, nor hear, or pray unworthily; but we admit them to hear, to pray, and to receive, and exhort them to doe it worthily. We partake with others in <hi>actu phyſico,</hi> but not in <hi>actu morali,</hi> neither in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or communication.</p>
               <p>For the Receivers part, I laid downe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 A natural man cannot do any thing as he ought, yet doth not that nullifie his duty; Invocation is a duty of the firſt Commandement. The unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man doth but take Gods Name in vaine when
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:119920:87"/>hee prayes, which is expreſly againſt the third; yet doth not the third Command make void the firſt. Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> excepts <hi>the Supper is not converting is Prayer;</hi> I ſay otherwiſe, they are a like; But with all, the rule we are to walke by in all duties is not the Event, but the precept, which alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered evacuates his plea; for as we muſt not doe any evill, that good may come of it; ſo muſt wee doe our duty, Gods Precept muſt be done ſtill, though evil come of it.</p>
               <p>page 116. <hi>A natural man muſt hear, pray, though he cannot rightly, becauſe they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, not ſo receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But firſt, Is it not a ſinne to heare not rightly? Secondly, Becauſe hearing the word is a means of converſion, doth that diſpence with the ſinne of hearing unworthily, and make it become no ſinne? Thirdly, If he ſinne in doing it, then is he bound to doe that, in doing whereof he ſinneth; and if he be, he muſt not omit the duty to avoid ſin. And what doe I ſay more concerning receiving the Sacrament?</p>
               <p n="2">2 Every man muſt doe what he can; hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>true but this is morally impoſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unlawfull;</hi> I reply, what Chriſt bids <hi>Doe,</hi> cannot bee unlawful becauſe it is done, but for the defect onely of the Doer, and therefore that failing it to be amended, but the duty ſtill to bee done. The doing of a thing not rightly, is but partial, but the not doing at all, total diſobedience.</p>
               <p n="3">3 There may be a difference between a worthy Receiver, and Receiving worthily; The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, as Mr. <hi>Pembles,</hi> he acknowledgeth good; In the uſe and meaning wee differ. It cannot bee ſaid of any that are legally unworthy, that they
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119920:87"/>can legally eat worthily; and if I conſtrue it onely, a man may be legally unworthy, yet Evangelically receive worthily; it is not <hi>ad idem,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is loſt; but if it ſtand thus, that a man may bee Evangelically unworthy, yet receive worthily in his kinde (to wit, as oppoſed to receiving unworthily in the Apoſtles ſenſe) ſo that it may pleaſe God to worke upon him by it; It is as full of ſweetneſſe as ever it can hold, that will have you examine your eſtates, and be ſenſible of them, and <hi>ſo</hi> come as condemning your ſelves, both legally unworthy, &amp; Evangelically unworthy, yet waiting on Chriſt to make you worthy, as knowing you can never bee ſaved on other termes, and being ready to ſay with the Lepers, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. <hi>Why ſit we here untill wee dye? If we enter into the City, the famine is in the City, and we ſhall dye there, and if we ſit ſtill here, we dye alſo.</hi> If we forſake Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or remaine in our condition, we are ſure of death; Now therefore let us fall into the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Convert thou us, and we ſhall bee converted,</hi> if he ſaves us alive, we ſhall live, and if he kils us, we ſhall but dye.</p>
               <p>If any approve not the diſtinction, which yet I hope no man will grudge me, <hi>Docendi gratia,</hi> it will bee all one to hold without it, that a man is to bee accounted to receive worthily, that makes an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual uſe thereof, according to his condition, whether regenerate, or not; and conſequently that all within the Church, may bee reckoned viſibly worthy, as well as viſibly in Covenant, or viſible Saints, although as hee leads mee the termes, in reference to trial, and evidence, I am forced to follow him, and oppoſe his ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:119920:88"/>
               <p>Page 117, <hi>How many are there outwardly pious, who upon trial might eaſily be uncaſed to live in ſome knowne ſinne? Each of theſe fearing to be uncaſed before the Elderſhip, no wonder they are averſe to trial, leſt their ſheeps-cloathing ſhould bee pulled off, and themſelves diſcovered to be ignorant, prophane, or hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</hi> So page before 49. <hi>The denial hereof, muſt needs vex hypocrites, who by this meanes are pryed into, and uncaſed.</hi> Conſider this with ſuch places, where he intimates that <hi>the Church is to require evidence, and try every profeſſor as to his ſincerity,</hi> page 17. and that otherwiſe, <hi>they ſhall be partakers of their ſinnes, if they doe not ſtudy, the diſcovery of perſons unworthy,</hi> page 120. and the <hi>people likewiſe,</hi> if they doe not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep them from receiving, page 109.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I pray read, ponder, and lay ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to heart, if it be not a ſad thing, to have ſuch grievous <hi>fears taught</hi> us <hi>by the precepts of men?</hi> Alas Sirs! Is not the Miniſters calling heavy enough? Are not his conteſts, and hatred more then he can undergoe already? Is not that ſerious duty of the receivers to examine themſelves, worke enough to take them up? And is there any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that enjoynes men to pry into others fitneſſe and unſitneſſe, or prevent ſinne in order to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, more then other duties? What a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den will men bring on tender ſpirits, which if wee ſhould doe curſorily, and negligently, and yet make conſcience of it as neceſſary, it will but bring a curſe on us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.10. and if wee ſhould goe to doe it ſeriouſly, what everlaſting difficulties, and troubles will it create for us? This is ſuch a terror cannot bee borne, while as the Iſraelites
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119920:88"/>ſprinkled their door poſts with bloud in the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that they might eſcape death; here is the bloud of the Sacrament as it were ſprinkled upon every ſoule that none may eſcape the guilt of it, but muſt be made fellow-murderers of Chriſt (as hee ſadly termes it) if any viſibly unworthy bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. For my part, if others will needs lay ſuch ſtrictneſs here on, I can but reverence them, the very ſhadow of holineſs is to be feared, but I can never thinke that the doore of the Sacrament (even to the Receivers owne part) is to be held quite as narrow as the doore to heaven, ſo long as the ſame men will maintaine that neceſſary diſtinction of the Church viſible, and inviſible.</p>
               <p>Page 118. <hi>If</hi> Mr. H. <hi>object ſuch perſons ought to be excommunicated, then it ſeems, wee offend rather in being too favourable then too rigid, that onely ſuſpend them, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This favour of his, which he ſo often ſpeaks of in ſuſpenſion, when yet he holds a man cannot be debarred any Ordinance, but actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in the greateſt cenſure, is methinks, juſt like the good woman, when the man fell off the houſe with an hatched by his ſide, and broke his necke; what a great mercy is it, ſayes ſhee, he had no more harme?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What then? therefore may it not bee adminiſtred to thoſe that are outwardly holy? 3 <hi>Bare profeſsion, if contradicted by prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, cannot ſecure a man from Excommunication, much leſſe from ſuſpenſion.

                  <q>Now I pray compare <hi>Mr. H.</hi> outward holy things to outward holy men, and inward holy things, to inward holy men; A viſible Ordinance to the viſible Church, and the inviſible grace to the inviſible members that have a ſaving intereſt in them by faith.</q> This was my anſwer, and is it not miſ-fortune thinke yee, that the ſame thing muſt be ſtrength in M. <hi>Drake,</hi> and yet weakneſſe in M. <hi>H.</hi> and that M. <hi>H.</hi> muſt bee thought to contradict himſelfe, when hee, poore creature, is apt to thinke M. <hi>Drake</hi> doth; Beſides, it is M. <hi>Drake</hi> ſayes here, not <hi>Mr. H.</hi> that a man is <hi>ſtill a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,</hi> when hee <hi>contradicts his Profeſsion,</hi> and is

               <p>Page 121. He cannot deny that <hi>All in the Church are in ſome ſenſe in Chriſt, and ſanctified by him,</hi> as I quoted thoſe Texts, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15.2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Heb,</hi> 10.29. &amp;c. From whence I argue, that thoſe who are in a Church-ſtate, in Covenant, or viſible communion, ſo that thereby they are ſaid to be in Chriſt, redeemed, and ſanctified, are to bee admitted accordingly to the ſeal and badge thereof, unleſſe ſuch as the Scripture gives ground to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; But all Church-members are in Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.1.10, 11. viſible Saints, &amp;c. and the Scripture allows no bar to any, unleſſe unintelligent, or excommunicate; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto this ſeeing it concerns the maine, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> gives us two anſwers;
1 <hi>Then Infants againe may be admitted:</hi> this is fourteen times.2 In ſhort, <hi>He is confident</hi> againſt it. A very maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful argument! which <hi>confidence</hi> yet (without proofe) whoſoever truſts to, ſhal finde but <hi>as a broken tooth, and foot out of joynt.</hi> And here I deſire the Reader to take notice, when he ſtill comes to this point, which is the foundation, whether it be ſufficient ſatisfaction, only to viliſie me, and ſlight it off. For as for this paſſage, with which he hath filled ſo many ſheets, about children, it is good for nothing, unleſſe they had happily been in parchment, and then it would have ſerved well, to make them Drums, and ſounded prettily by the emptineſſe.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:119920:90"/>
               <p>Page 122. <hi>How groſſe is that aſſertion that there is an hiſtorical viſible faith that gives an out ward Church right unto the Elements? Anſw.</hi> Nay rather how cleare and firme a truth doth it appear, by the former Argument? That faith, which ſerves to enter a man in external Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and engage him to the termes thereof, wil ſerve to admit him to the Sacraments; but, a faith onely accepting the true God, in oppoſition to all other Religions doth ſerve for that, appears by the Covenanting of the whole body of Iſrael, <hi>Deut,</hi> 29.10, 12. <hi>Ergo,</hi> All Profeſſors or Church-members that have but a common, general, hiſtorical, or viſible faith (for any of theſe termes ſerve me) I ſay are in Covenant, but the Covenant is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither will the right underſtanding hereof doe any hurt to the Church, I hope, ſo long as we preſſe, nevertheleſſe, a ſolid ſaving faith, to intereſt them in the effectual benefits of them both.</p>
               <p>His Exceptions are,
1 <hi>Then the Excommunicate have a right, for they have ſtilan hiſtorical faith. Anſw.</hi> How vaine is this? who knowes not the ſtate of the queſtion ſuppoſes us within the Church?2 <hi>Some excommunicate may alſo have a true ſaving faith.</hi> See how fairly, inſtead of oppoſing me, he checks himſelfe. I pray marke his ſtrength in both, becauſe neither an hiſtorical, nor ſaving faith gives a man a right that is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, and thereby made no Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, therefore they cannot give him a right when hee is not excommunicate, and is a Church-member.3 <hi>As hiſtorical faith, gives not a right to Chriſt, but faith of adheſion; ſo a viſible faith of adheſion, gives right to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:119920:90"/>Chriſt ſacramental. Anſw.</hi>
1 I might returne to him, Why may not ſome excommunicate perſons, have ſuch a viſible faith of adheſion, as an hiſtorical ſaving one: But.2 An hiſtorical faith is <hi>ſuo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi> a true faith, as the Eunuchs, <hi>I beleeve that Chriſt is the Sonne of God. Act.</hi> 8.37.3 An hiſtorical ſaith which was barely ſo, and not ſaving gave <hi>Simon Magus</hi> admiſſion unto Baptiſme, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13. and here <hi>Adultis eadem ratio</hi> holds firme.4 Faith of adheſion I take to be an aſſent with application, and that is ſpecial faith, which I queſtion whether it may be termed viſible, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from ſaving.5 It is ſufficient to mee, that a faith which generally aſſents to the truth of the Covenant, and engages to it, and yet falls ſhort of juſtifying, entitles to the Sacraments, for otherwiſe we ſhal quite confound the worke of the Miniſter, and the Spirit, the ſymbolical, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Seal, and then no man can be admitted at all without preſumption.6 When the Papiſts prove that hiſtorical faith juſtifies, becauſe it ſufficed unto Baptiſme, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. Some of our able Divines anſwer, It is true, Profeſſion of faith gives intereſt to Baptiſme, yet it is not ſufficient to Juſtification, Dr. <hi>Slater</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22.</p>
               <p>There is a manifeſt difference between a title to the Sacraments, and intereſt in the ſaving benefits; A general faith gives title to one, a ſpecial to the other. Regeneration is like <hi>David,</hi> that enjoyes <hi>Michal;</hi> when Profeſſion, like <hi>Phaltiel comes along behinde weeping to Bahurim.</hi> A general faith hath ſome union with Chriſt, as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, a ſaving union; Profeſſion, like <hi>Orphah,</hi> may kiſſe <hi>Naomi,</hi> when a ſaving faith, like <hi>Ruth,</hi> cleaves unto her.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> THe fourth Objection is, <hi>The Seal is ſet to a Blanke, if all be admitted.</hi> My anſwer was, from conſideration of what is ſealed; It is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſaid, the Sacrament is the ſeale of faith (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lyes the difficulty;) I ſay onely it is a Seale of the Covenant; The Goſpel is the writing, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as the ſeale to that writing; the Writing is true, and the Seal true, whoſoever is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſſe there is ſo much confuſion in this buſineſſe, eſpecially in <hi>Mr. D.</hi> who is uſually moſt aſſertive when leaſt adviſed, that it will be in vaine to diſpute <hi>Andabatarum more,</hi> with termes blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded. Theſe termes then, ſealing to a blanke, ſealing to our faith, and ſealing the Covenant, I judge are ambiguous; when we differ onely in termes, we may reconcile in our meaning; but where we differ in our matter, one of us muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, Sealing to a blank may relate to the thing, or perſon; when I ſay there is no ſealing to a blank, I mean as the thing ſealed; for it is not the unbelief of man can make the Covenant of God of no effect. Now when here he takes <hi>a blanke</hi> as relating to perſons, he ſayes nothing, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently anſwered, we hold none are viſible blanks within the Church: but when he refers it to the thing, as I do, here ariſes our difference.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sealing of faith, or to faith, we either meane as the thing ſealed, or the condition requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to the exhibition thereof; When I ſay the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is not a ſeal of faith, I mean it ſtill as the thing ſealed (to wit, on Gods part.) A Seal is an Appendix to writing, the Sacrament is not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:119920:91"/>an Appendix to faith, but to the Goſpel. Now againe, If he meane here, by this expreſſion, <hi>It is a ſeale to our faith,</hi> onely, that faith is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon which alone, Chriſt and his benefits are conveyed, it is, what none doubteth, and for words we contend not. But when he ſayes, It is the ſeale of Faith, referring it as I doe to the thing ſealed, our controverſie here muſt continue, and there is but one thing to looke into, to wit, the ſenſe wherein, or grounds whereon, he thus holds it; which I ſhall ſatisfie, after I have laid downe theſe other diſtinctions likewiſe, about ſealing the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as neceſſary to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly then, There are 3 things I humbly think are to be diſtinguiſhed, concerning the Covenant;
1 The condition thereof, on mans part;2 The benefits, on Gods part.3 The tenour, which conſiſts, or reſults our of both. The word Sealing accordingly is uſed (I thinke) ſometimes, for to binde, or engage; ſometimes to confirme or ratifie, and ſometimes to convey or exhibit, which are offices of a Seal (with others) and do not a little puzzle our conceptions. Now when we ſay the Sacrament ſeals the Covenant, as ſealing is taken for confirming, aſſuring, or ratifying (which is the propereſt ſenſe thereof) it is moſt genuinely applied to the tenour of it; As it is underſtood for conveying or exhibiting, it is proper to the benefits; As it is uſed to engage or oblige, it is moſt large, and may be applied to the condition with the diſtinction (if we allow it) as mans ſeal, and not otherwiſe; for as it is Gods Seal, in none of theſe ſenſes, it ſeals the condition, God engages not hereby, to give man Faith; if he did, every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver ſhould have it; what he ſeals to, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:119920:92"/>
               <p>Now then to come to our difference, the ground on which the Sacrament is held a Seal of Faith, or to our Faith (which termes I ſhall not diſtinguiſh for him) is uſually this, becauſe it confirmes our Faith, that which confirmes or ratifies (ſay they) is metaphorically a Seal, ſo is the Sacrament to our Faith.</p>
               <p>For ſatisfaction; 1 I diſtinguiſh, A thing may be confirmed or ratiſied, either <hi>Formalitèr,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and formally, or <hi>Conſequutivè,</hi> by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence onely, and improperly in the event. It is not enough to make a thing a Seal, that it confirms any way in the event, but that it formally confirmes and ratifies. Now the Sacrament confirmes and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies the Covenant properly and formally, as a ſeal ſet to a writing, ratifies the tenor and purport of it, but it confirmes faith improperly, and conſequently onely, to wit, it encreaſes it, as other Ordinances doe, in the exerciſe thereof, all habits being ſtrengthned by their acts, which you ſee is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and eventual to ſealing. Whatſoever God doth properly ratifie by way of Seale, he atteſts the truth thereof, but he doth not atteſt the truth of our faith by the Sacrament, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Sacrament is not the ſeale of Faith. Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> anſwer to this (in <hi>Marg.</hi> p. 128.) that he doth it by conſequence, will not ſerve; for I argue, That which is common to the hypocrite with the beleever cannot atteſt the truth of a mans faith (ſignifie or aſcertaine him that he hath grace) by any conſequence that is good; But the Sacrament, is common to both; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 I humbly judge, The Sacraments are not Seals becauſe they confirme our faith (which is the errour) but they confirme our faith, becauſe they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119920:92"/>are Seales. As to uſe Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> inſtance, When <hi>a bond ſealed unto me confirmes my beliefe, that the particulars ſealed ſhall be performed:</hi> The Seal to the Bond is not a Seal, becauſe it confirmes me, but I am confirmed by it, becauſe it is a ſeale; and this is onely an effect it hath on me; for the Seal would be the ſame, and writing too, though I were incredulous. It is derogatory, I thinke, to ſay the Sacrament is onely a metaphorical ſeal, or tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically a ſeal, which they are forced to ſay, that make it a ſeal of Faith, from the conſequent effect, of confirming <hi>faith inherent in the worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver;</hi> whereas indeed it is a very proper formal ſeal to the Covenant; and thus the text <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. ſpeaks plaine for us; circumciſion is not ſaid to be a ſeale of faith (or that a man hath faith) for righteouſneſſe; but <hi>the Seale of the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> which in Geneſis is phraſed, <hi>The token of the Covenant.</hi> If confirming or ſtrengthning a mans faith were enough to denominate it a ſeale;
1 Then Acts of grace ſhould be the beſt ſeales.2 Then ſhould all other Ordinances be feals too.3 Then Baptiſme ſhould be no ſeal to infants.4 And then ſhall both the Sacraments ceaſe to be Seals, when any are admitted that have not true Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Let us conſider what faith is confirmed. Every act ſuppoſes its object, ſuch as is the object, ſuch muſt be the act; the object the Sacrament ſeals is no other, but what is in the word (for <hi>Mr. D.</hi> and I, here ſtill agree, that theſe <hi>go together.</hi>) The word ſpeaks onely in general, whoſoever beleeves ſhall be ſaved; this general, neceſſarily includes its particular, ſo that the faith which is directly and immediately confirmed, is my aſſent to his truth,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:119920:93"/>that if I beleeve I ſhall have Chriſt, or be juſtified and ſaved; Onely whereas a true hiſtoricall aſſent; and particular faith of evidence, are not divided, though diſtinguiſhed in the regenerate, but are one habit, men may not much ſcruple to ſay, the one is confirmed inſtead of the other. Yet as to this Point, where the whole ſtreſſe is laid upon it, it is to be conſidered, and wee are to know, that if a man would come to be aſſured of his faith (that it is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) it muſt ariſe from his own examination, and experience, and it cannot be confirmed to him any otherwiſe. And as for thoſe further degrees of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance (if grounded) he attains at the Sacrament, they are not conveyed to him by obſignation (there is ſome danger and weakneſſe to think ſo) but are acquired through Gods Spirit; by exerciſe of his heart at that time in the ſight of his experiences and meditation (the great buſineſſe he hath to do here) no otherwiſe then at other Ordinances, which do all <hi>agere</hi> onely, <hi>virtute ſuoe ſignificationis,</hi> or by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall operation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall end this with a plaine conſideration; a Seale ſo confirmes a Bond, as it was not confirmed before: but there is no Faith of particular evidence (that Chriſt is mine) can be confirmed by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament (I ſay, <hi>ratione obſignationis</hi>) but what is confirmed to me already by my experience, and therefore it is a mean thing, to count it onely tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically a ſeale to confirme faith, when it is a ſeale formally to confirm the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon Mr. <hi>D.</hi> hath, more peculiar, and affected. <hi>Faith is a part of the Covenant, and the Covenant being ſealed, Faith is ſealed.</hi> For the diſcuſſing this, we all know there is mans part of the Covenant, and Gods; mans part is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:119920:93"/>which God does not ſeale to; if he did, my buſineſſe were at an end, for then all were to come hither for it; Gods part is the Promiſe, wherein he engages to give us the benefits upon this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now as Faith is our Condition, it is manifeſt it cannot be part of the Covenant which God ſeal, whereof onely we ſpeak: And Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is at ſuch a loſſe p. 134. For how ſhall faith be promiſed in the Covenant, when men cannot be in Covenant (effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) without Faith? that is, how can Faith be promiſed upon condition we doe beleeve? Let us diſtinguiſh then.</p>
               <p n="1">1 There is the abſolute, or conditionall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; or there is the Covenant made with us, and the Covenant made with Chriſt; Faith is not given by vertue of the Covenant made with man, but it flowes from the Promiſe God hath made to Chriſt, that upon doing his work, this ſhall be his wages, To have a ſeed, a people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. that is, many ſhall beleeve in him. Now the Sacrament ſeales not the abſolute Covenant, or the everlaſting engagements between God and Chriſt; but it ſeales the conditional Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or the Covenant made with man, and ſo not Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To proceed more ſtrictly, There is the firſt Grace, and ſecond Grace. Faith as the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the further degrees of it. If it be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, theſe further degrees comes under the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Promiſe: I Anſwer, For my part, I judge from whence comes the firſt Grace, from thence flows Perſeverance, by the former Texts, with <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Jo.</hi> 17.9, 10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is from the abſolute Promiſe, and this makes it incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed, in the Doctrine whereof we are loath
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:119920:94"/>to looſe ſo good a ſtay at our backs; and if Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance belongs to the abſolute Promiſe, the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the firſt Grace does likewiſe. In <hi>Progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Grace</hi> then, there is the work it ſelfe, or an acceſſory conſideration of it, as a reward to initial; though there is not the leaſt degree of Grace, but what is wrought by the Holy Spirit, yet he does ſo ſweetly attemper his work to our Wils, that he propoſes it as the reward and fruits of our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors in the right uſe of the firſt ſtock he hath given us; and ſo declares, or promiſes, <hi>To him that hath it ſhall be given;</hi> Upon which promiſe there ariſes a right of the ſecond Grace to him that hath the firſt; and this Right only as to Reall Grace (to wit, that God will crown his own effectuall work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with more) is all can be ſealed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. To clear this a little more, Whereas wee ſpeake here of the Grace the Covenant promiſes, that is the benefits, let us know,
1. The word Sealing, we are to take for conveighing or exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.2. That the grace of the promiſe is either <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative,</hi> that makes a change onely as to our ſtate and relation towards God (as Juſtification, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and this is conveyed every Sacrament (<hi>ſuo modo</hi>) to the Beleever; or <hi>Reall,</hi> as theſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degrees of Faith Love, &amp;c. and Glory, which change the heart and perſon; and this being a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall thing, cannot be conveyed by obſignation. A moral Inſtrument acts not phyſically. To ſpeake freely in this ſenſe of obſignation, the Sacrament does no more Sanctifie us, then Glorifie us; It is then a <hi>right</hi> to further Sanctification, as to glory, which is ſealed, that is, exhibited, or conveyed to us by the Sacrament; and as for the effectuall worke it ſelfe of the firſt or ſecond: Grace alike,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:119920:94"/>it is the free gift of God, inſinuated in all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, through the propoſition of the object, by morall action.</p>
               <p>To ſum up the whole Mr. <hi>D.</hi> can have here, it comes to this; whereas the Sacrament as a ſeale, conveyes and exhibits the benefits of the Covenant (to wit Relative Grace, and a right to Reall) to true Beleevers, and not elſe, the ſeale muſt be ſet to a blank (he may count) where there is no ſaving Faith, and if any are viſibly ſuch, they ought not to be admitted.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer 1. By way of conceſſion, as to the antecedent, which is true, and the ſenſe is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Sacrament ſeales the <hi>benefits</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant upon condition, or thoſe onely that have the condition, have a right to the benefits of it. The man could nor be ſo cenſorious, if he had not ſome good meaning. To expreſſe this in <hi>Auſtines</hi> words, there is <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> and <hi>Res Sacramenti; panis Dominus,</hi> and <hi>Panis Domini;</hi> It is true, though all receive the Sacrament, and <hi>Panem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> yet none receive <hi>rem Sacramenti,</hi> and <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Dominum,</hi> but ſuch as have true ſaving faith.</p>
               <p>But 2. By way of negation to the conſequence, It does not follow where the benefits are not exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the ſeale is ſet to a blank. For
1. The Covenant is ſealed either in regard of the tenor of it, or the benefits; though the benefits (in this ſenſe) are not ſealed (that is conveyed) yet is the tenor of the Covenant ſealed (that is, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ratified, the cheife ſenſe we contend for) to all the receivers; and there can bee no ſeale to a blank, ſo long as there is truth and writing in the Goſpel2. As the generall truth of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:119920:95"/>is ſealed to all, ſo is every mans particular intereſt ſealed according to his condition, and he is ſeriouſly to make his uſe thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3 By way of further ſatisfaction, if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> will call it ſealing to a blanke, when the benefits are not, exhibited, the man may uſe what unhandſome terms he will, but I will ſay if that be all, there is no abſurdity in it. For
1. <hi>God hath commanded to baptiſe all Infants of Beleevers, and to admit all viſible Saints,</hi> (as himſelfe ſayes, p. 123.) which yet have not all the benefits exhibited, and we muſt not think the eternall Wiſdom puts us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an abſurdity.2. The Lord Jeſus ſubmitted to the Sacraments, yet could not the benefits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, or regeneration, be ſealed to him that never ſinned.3. Nevertheleſſe, as he was to doe this, <hi>to fulfill all righteouſneſſe;</hi> ſo are we bound ſtill to doe our duty.4. As there is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Grace, as remiſſion of ſin, and a right to life, exhibited to the ſound Beleever; ſo there is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Judgement (if I may ſo ſay) as retention of ſin, and <hi>debitum ſupplicii,</hi> a due, or deſert of death, exhibited to the unſound, which he is to apply for his Conviction and Reformation.5. If he does not, yet is the Ordinance hereby made a ſweet ſavor of Chriſt unto God, though a ſavor of death to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 By way of inquity, I queſtion. 1. How Gods eſtabliſhing his Covenant by way of ſeal, does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this exhibition of the effectual benefits, to thoſe he ſeales? There may indeed be outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church, neceſſarily made over here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? but the inward benefits of the Covenant, are engaged for, or ſtipulated on Gods part to bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only upon condition, which man may be bound
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:119920:95"/>to before the performance. I pray compare tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2 I queſtion, Whether a man that ſcruples at the Sacrament, as having not evidence to receive it as a ſeale, may, and muſt not yet receive it as a ſign; My reaſon is, all men within the Church, are bound to remember the death of Chriſt, and be thankful, if it were but onely for that he hath brought them under a poſſibility, probability, and the means of ſalvation; But the whole inſtitution is ordained for a thankful remembrance in the ſhewing forth his death, and benefits of it, wherein the whole Church is viſibly intereſſed, <hi>Ergo.</hi> If any reply, There is more then this to be don, I ſay, true, let not anythink that is all; but I aske, is not this yet his duty? This one particular cannot be denyed, and if it be his duty, his failings and impotence otherwiſe, cannot evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it; they muſt be amended, and this muſt be done. Wemuſt not do evil that good may come of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we muſt do our duty, though evill comes of it.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:119920:96"/>
               <p>And now I come to his book, p. 123. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with approbation of the objection; <hi>All men</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>are naturally</hi> Raſae tabulae, <hi>destitute of the new Covenant in their hearts,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>and ſo blanks, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> great error, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the outward and inward Covenant, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and internal ſealing; If the ſeale be ſet to a blank, untill Gods Law is written in the heart, then no mortall can apply the ſeale to any, ſeeing that cannot bee diſcerned by any. Compare this therefore with p. 72. <hi>Let the world know</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>that truth of Grace in the heart is not the rule of our admiſſion.</hi> Now I pray note it, if he applies theſe Texts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. (which ſpeaks onely of this inward writing) to confirm the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that the ſeale is ſet to a blank if all be admitted; then the world muſt know that the truth of grace is his rule, or elſe the new Covenant written in the heart, is not truth of grace with Mr. <hi>Drake.</hi> Here you ſee the left legſet firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the mans rule had need be better then his reaſon.</p>
               <p>He proceeds, <hi>This blanke is either viſible, or inviſible; to God all blankes are viſible, and he may uſe his liberty to ſet his ſeale where hee pleaſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In what a ſad caſe has he here brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſelfe through his former error, when he muſt lay this for his foundation, that <hi>the God of Iſrael</hi> may ſet his ſeale to <hi>a viſible blanke,</hi> that ſtiles himſelfe by this title, <hi>who cannot lye?</hi> If the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, who is Gods Embaſſadour, ſeales to a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible blank, it is ſuch an heinous ſin, he ſaies, as murdering Chriſt: and yet does hee affirme, that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:119920:96"/>God ſets his ſeal to a viſible blanke without ſcruple. It is no wonder that the man deals ſo courſely with me, that uſes ſuch rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil language towards God.</p>
               <p>He goes on, and tels how (p. 124) <hi>by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baptiſme of Infants, and to admit to the Lords Supper all viſible Saints that are, Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; The queſtion is then whether man may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ſeals to viſible blankes, &amp;c. Anſ.</hi> I pray marke this over againe, God may uſe his liberty to ſet his ſeal to a viſible blanke (he ſayes) by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all viſible Saints to be admitted; but his queſtion is, Whether man may apply it? that is, <hi>the queſtion is, Whether man may doe as God hath commanded him?</hi> Viſible Saints are all one with viſible members, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6. &amp;c. ſo that it ſeems by that time the man came to this place, he was never convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

But in caſe any make a forfeiture, which he ſayes, the Church ought to take; It is manifeſt then he muſt be excommunicate, that is, put out of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or external Covenant; for while he ſtands <hi>De jure</hi> entituled as a member, it is a manifeſt wrong to ſuſpend him the ſymbol thereof: And here our diſtinction of <hi>Ipſo jure</hi> diſ-membred, and ſo <hi>De preſenti</hi> diſ-tituled muſt do its ſervice, in ſome ſcruples, which will be even forced to ſay, <hi>I have need of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the things to which theſe Seals relate, Page 126. he ſaies,
1 <hi>They confirme the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi> which is moſt true, <hi>and therefore all may be preſent to ſee,</hi> not eat. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The bare Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do not confirme the Covenant, but the Elements as inſtituted to that uſe, but they were inſtituted to be eaten and drunken, and therefore thoſe that are preſent muſt receive too, to wit, if they be intelligent members.2 <hi>They confirme the faith of the worthy receiver, therefore none but Evangelically worthy may partake. Anſ.</hi> He may as well argue thus, Baptiſme confirmes the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119920:97"/>faith onely of thoſe that underſtand it, therefore Infants may not partake of it. The word and prayer confirme faith, therefore none but the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate may heare and pray. This is no conſequence, for whatſoever Ordinance can confirme faith, may beget it.3 <hi>They confirme judgement to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiver. Anſw.</hi> And I pray now what is become of the blanke? By this it appears the whole Covenant is ſealed, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16, 16. and ſo there is no ſealing to a blanke poſſible. Hee that beleeves not ſhall be damned, is ſealed, as well as he that beleeves ſhall be ſaved; ſo that I humbly judge the right uſe hereof is but to bee taught the people, and our controverſie may bee done.</p>
               <p>There is a vaſt difference between a phyſical, and moral inſtrument; and likewiſe between what is Really and Relatively conveyed; If real judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were phyſically conveyed by the Covenant and Sacrament, it were death but once to touch it, or but once to heare the word without faith. But it is not ſo, God forbid, we ſhould have ſuch merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thoughts of him; It is final unbeleefe onely that ſhall be <hi>really</hi> damned. The truth is, both the Covenant and Seal, do ſtill hold forth life <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially</hi> to a ſinner, if he will repent, when it <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> ſets death before his preſent condition; Hee is now then to deſpaire of ſinne, he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to deſpiar of mercy upon converſion unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For his next things, I ſpeak to other where; There is one paſſage onely here, muſt yet be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is this, <hi>The Sacrament will confirme the unworthy receivers unbeleefe. Anſw.</hi> You muſt take heed of this, by your ſerious application.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119920:98"/>Indeed I thinke the Sacrament ſeals judgement to every unregenerate man, according to the termes of the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition in this ſyllogiſme, (He that beleeves not, ſhall be damned, I beleeve not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall be damned) but not, in any hand, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the termes of the concluſion, Let every ſoule aſſure himſelfe thereof. But for the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming his unbeleefe,</hi> that follows here onely, as at the word, and prayer; A man may be unworthy, yet by Gods grace, pray, hear, and receive wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily; for while he rightly applies the word, or ſeale, according to his condition, it will be the very means, I hope, to remove his unbeleefe, and quicken him to repentance, which the Lord grant to poor ſinners.</p>
               <p>Page 127. <hi>The Sacrament doth confirme faith, and ratifie the Covenant to faith,</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is a ſeale of faith, and to faith. Anſw.</hi>
1 The Sacrament confirmes not faith <hi>formalitèr,</hi> as I have ſaid, but onely <hi>conſequutivè,</hi> as other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances doe, and that is not enough to make it a ſeal.2 The Sacrament ratifies the Covenant to all, whether they have ſaving faith or no, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits the benefits onely upon that condition; ſo that <hi>to ſeal to faith</hi> is nothing elſe, but that it ſeals conditionally, which anſwers the whole objection. <hi>Econtra: where there is no faith to confirme, it ſeals to a blanke, as ſealing a paper without wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> Here is his conſtant errour, for the writing the Sacrament ſeales to, is not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Covenant in the heart, but the outwart in the Goſpel. For his Argument from the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>How can the Minister ſay, this is the blood of Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſinne to the unworthy?</hi> Every one can reſolve, as Chriſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119920:98"/>ſaid the ſame to <hi>Judas,</hi> whereof before.</p>
               <p>Page 128. He hath foure things;
1 He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, <hi>God doth not atteſt our faith.</hi> I returne, But Seals are teſtimonies, and if he does not give teſtimony to our faith, he does not ſeale to it.2 He ſaies, <hi>Some reject the Covenant;</hi> This he repeats page 131 where I ſhall anſwer it.3 There is the old buſineſſe of Infants, and the diſtracted, which is fifteen times.4 <hi>The Seals may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied before all, not to them, &amp;c.</hi> Anſw. <hi>Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in this thing you are too ſuperſtitious.</hi> I pray ſee the ſixth Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> verſ. 53.56. <hi>Verily except you eat my fleſh, and drinke my blood you have no life in you; but whoſoever eateth, &amp;c. hath eternal life.</hi> Theſe words cannot be meant of the Sacrament;
1 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was not then inſtituted;And 2. Men may never eat him in the Sacrament, yet be ſaved. Now take this ſixth of <hi>John</hi> out of the Supper, that which remaines onely muſt be the ſeal, and what becomes of all this dreadfulneſſe then, that is laid upon our conſciences with a bare <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not?</hi> Let a man only look on, he ſhall be ſure to be damned nevertheleſſe, if he eats not the fleſh, and drinkes not the blood of the Sonne of man by a true faith; and as ſure to be ſaved if he does, according to this text of St. <hi>John,</hi> alike, whether he receives, or receives not. This actual receiving then, ſerves but to affect us the more ſolemnly with our condition, and be a more ſerious obligation by the outward, to that inward eating, whereby alone we looke to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Page 129. He is notable, The Sacrament he counts it <hi>not a ſeale properly, but figuratively, to

So in the former leaf he concludes it <hi>tropically a ſeal.</hi> Well, now read but a few lines further, in the very ſame page, and he tels us, <hi>As it confirmes the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it confirmes Faith; and if this be not to ſeale in a proper formall ſenſe theologically, I know not what is.</hi> Is not this pretty? The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not a proper, formall ſeale, but figurative, and metaphoricall; and yet if it does not ſeale in a proper, formall ſence, he knowes not what does.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Unto this Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſhall firſt anſwer. Mr.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:119920:99"/>
                  <hi>D.</hi> ſpeaking of Infant baptiſme, he tells us, <hi>Be their parents never ſo unworthy</hi> p. 81. Yet
1. <hi>Though they tranſgreſſe, they do not renounce the Covenant, as Turks do.</hi>2. <hi>They are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church till ex communicated,</hi> p. 84. Well, now let him come to ſpeake about the Sacrament, p. 131. <hi>All who are viſibly in the ſtate of nature</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>are viſibly out of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> I pray marke it, if naturall men be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church, how are they viſibly out of Covenant? If they are viſibly in Chriſt, how doe they viſibly reject Chriſt? And now then, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this I will anſwer him.
1. There is a difference between diſobedience and renouncing; between a not reſolving, and reſolving not to accept of Chriſt.2. How can Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſay any viſibly reject the Covenant of Grace, when they viſibly come to engage themſelves unto it?3. So long as the Lord ownes a people in Covenant, the Miniſter may apply the outward ſeales of it; But while men are Church-members, the Lord does own them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly as his people, even <hi>when they will not hearken, and will none of him, Pſal.</hi> 81.8, 11. that is plainly <hi>reject the Covenant,</hi> as to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when they are ignorant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6. and ſcandalous, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 106.39. with ver. 45. <hi>They went a whoring after their owne inventions, yet remembred he for them his Covenant.</hi>4. So long as men are not excommunicate, I ſee no reaſon why Chriſt may not be offered Sacramentally, as free as verbally, to worke them to repentance; for the offering a ſealed pardon in general (the generall alwaies including the particulars) and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars applying the ſame to ſingle perſons <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally,</hi> whatſoever this manſurmiſes, is but the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:119920:100"/>ſame. If he can ſay to all, whoſoever beleeves ſhall be ſaved, he can ſay ſo to me; unleſſe all, does not include mee; and abſolutely the Sacrament ſeales no mans intereſt, as alike vainly he imagines.5. If men doe not walke conformable to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the denouncing the judgement of God, and the ſealing of it, ſeriouſly applyed, is the means to reforme them.6. When other meanes will not work upon them, there remains Excommunication, and let that content him.</p>
               <p>Page 132. He does but repeate the ſame.</p>
               <p>Page 133. He hath three things,
1. <hi>The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Gods ſeales, as relating to Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and as inſtituted to ratifie the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Anſ.</hi> A good confeſſion, Then they are not Gods ſeales as relating to Faith, and as inſtituted formally to ratifie Faith: They are not ſeales of Faith for Righteouſneſſe, but they are ſeales of the righteouſneſſe of Faith, in oppoſition to Works.2. <hi>Is not Faith, and every ſaving Grace promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the New Covenant, unleſſe Mr.</hi> H. <hi>will turn Pelagian? Anſ.</hi> I beleeve here Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> other ſtudies has beguiled his Divinity; for hee may be pleaſed to know, we neither make Faith the birth of mans Free Will, nor yet to be given by vertue of the Covenant made with man, which the Sacrament ſeals, but to be Gods moſt free gift, that proceeds from election, and diſcovers the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery thereof.3. <hi>If the Covenant be Gods, if the Seale be Gods, and Faith promiſed in it be Gods alſo; is it not apparent, that Gods ſeale, muſt needs be Faiths ſeale alſo? Anſw.</hi> If hee count this apparent, which is a very Chaos, you may gueſſe what light to expect from him. The
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119920:100"/>truth is, As faith is our condition, it is not a branch of the Covenant that God ſeales, which puzzles this man; for if it were, every man ſhould unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably come, and engage the Lord by his owne ſeale to undertake for his condition (as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready intimated) and conſequently if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he engages, every one ſhould bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>This he ſees p. 134, 135. and is quite loſt in his very firſt particular; for while hee ſuppoſes, the Covenant promiſes initiall grace to the Elect, and the Sacrament ſeales that Covenant, and the ſeale ſecures what is in the writing (which are all his own termes) he muſt neceſſarily take upon him to judge who are reprobates, which is ſinfull to doe; or all muſt be admitted: for though men are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly yet in the ſtate of nature, they may be elect. Had not the man ſo much contemned me, he might have found how to diſtinguiſh between what comes from Gods undertaking with man, or the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional boſome of the Covenant; and what comes from his undertaking with Chriſt, or the free, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute boſome of Election. I pray compare his third particular with this firſt, The Sacrament, he ſayes there, <hi>is for nouriſhment</hi> (and that I hope to the Elect) So p, 147. <hi>It ſeals not initiall, but progreſſive Graece;</hi> and yet here, <hi>the Covenant</hi> (he counts) <hi>promiſes initiall grace to the Elect, and the ſeal ſecures what is in the Covenant.</hi> So that ☜ what need I here to diſpute with Mr. <hi>D.</hi> when his own particulars have an opponent and defendant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and do riſe up methinks but like the heads and horns ſtill in the Viſions, to revile, and fight with one another. I will here therefore poſe theſe two pages of Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> with theſe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:119920:101"/>Queſtions.
1. Whether it be one and the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant he ſpeakes of there?2. How the Covenant being conditional doth promiſe abſolutely?3. How it can promiſe initial Grace? for Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are the condition of the Covenant, and how can faith be promiſed upon condition we have faith, or the firſt grace be given upon condition we have grace?4. What difference is there between the Covenants offer of grace, and promiſe of grace conditionally?5. How can the offer of Grace be ſaid to be ſealed, as Offer is diſtinguiſhed from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe?6. Whether the Miniſter can ſeale which he pleaſe, either the Offer or Promiſe, and why he ſhould not content himſelfe to ſeale the offer, which is ſure to all preſent, rather then to ſeal the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe where he may erre, ſeeing his viſible Legatees really may not bee ſuch? By theſe Queſtions happily it may appeare Mr. <hi>D.</hi> does not ſee all things.</p>
               <p>Page 136. <hi>Christ may be given to all, or held forth in the Sacrament, though they doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What an unworthy ſhift is this, to bee made uſe of ſo often! As Chriſt is held forth to all Sacramentally, he is held forth to this end, to be Sacramentally eaten and drunken; <hi>Take, eate, this is my body;</hi> that is, thus taken, and eaten, it is his body, not otherwiſe: The Sacrament then gives not out Chriſt, or holds him forth Sacramentally, but to thoſe that receive it. <hi>And they all dranke of the rocke, which was Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame page, he hath up Infants, and the diſtracted againe, which is ſixteen times, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues from the word, <hi>As the Miniſter may not loſe by the Key of doctrine, ſuch as are to bee
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:119920:101"/>bound, no more may be ſeal comfort, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> As the Miniſter doth not onely looſe, but binde in the word, ſo does he in the Sacrament; and as he neither bindes nor looſes, but conditionally in the one; no more does he ſeal comforts, or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (and ſo terrours) in the other. As for that onely Objection againſt this conditional ſealing he hath over the leaſe, that <hi>then heathen, and the excommunicate may be admitted;</hi> I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, The word is a ſealed word onely to the Church; It is apparent, the ſeal is delivered onely for her uſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and therefore to be applied (by expreſſe Text, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.28.) onely to her members.</p>
               <p>Page 137, 138. He contends without cauſe that the Sacraments are mans ſeals, which in his ſenſe that they are appointed to his uſe <hi>(in a propriety of the final cauſe)</hi> who doubts? but in that ſenſe which regards him that ſets the ſeal, as if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſhould make Articles with me, the ſetting his ſeal is not mine; ſo do I think ſome wiſer then Mr. <hi>D.</hi> may not judge it any thing <hi>ridiculous,</hi> to make the ſeal Gods only, and our mutual reſtipulation, (I mean the performance of it) to ariſe as the good uſe we are to make thereof. If any contend for words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> give place.</p>
               <p>Pag. 139. Whereas I ſay the tenour of the Goſpel is abſolutely ſealed but not our intereſt in it abſolutely; which diſtinction I deſire to have marked, becauſe our intereſt relates to the benefits, and they are ſealed (that is exhibited) only on condition; and our aſſurance can be no otherwiſe: He anſwers, <hi>This is true in the firſt branch, but falſe in the ſecond, ſince not onely the tenour of the Covenant is ſealed abſolutely to the worthy
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:119920:102"/>receiver, but alſo his intereſt in it. Anſw.</hi> A very ſhrewd Argument; It is not, why? becauſe it is not. My reaſon I give here is, becauſe the word ſpeaks not abſolutely of any mans ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; He anſwers, <hi>It does by ſignes, and if any finde thoſe ſignes in himſelfe it is as good, as if he were mentioned by name. Anſw.</hi> If a mans particular intereſt depends upon theſe ſigns and marks, then is his intereſt only conditional, and muſt be ſealed as it is, which is the thing I prove. I pray conſider this plainly, when the word tels me, Faith is the condition of the Covenanant, it ſets forth what faith it is, or the true ſigns, marks, and deſcription thereof, and it is all one to ſay, If thou doſt beleeve, or if thou haſt theſe ſigns or marks. Now the Sacrament ſeals my intereſt in the benefits of the Covenant only upon the condition, that I have theſe ſigns wherein conſiſts this true faith, and not otherwiſe; But the word doth no where tell me I have theſe marks, or ſigns, and therefore the Sacrament cannot ſeal to me my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt but conditionally; which is ſo clear that all the clouds in Mr. <hi>D.</hi> head can never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeure it.</p>
               <p>And whereas in the ſame Page he ſpeaks for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately, <hi>that a viſible intereſt is ſealed to viſible Saints.</hi> I aſſume; But Church-members are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly holy, or viſible Saints, therefore <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis conſiderandis</hi> muſt be admitted.</p>
               <p>Page 140 to 149. He brings in the ſyllogiſme I quoted from Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (in <hi>Aphor. Ap.</hi>) where by the way, let me admoniſh Mr. <hi>D.</hi> to take heed of this ſelf-conceit, prejudice, and bitter ſpirit, he ſhews in thoſe By-expreſſions of his upon a man ſo precious in the hearts of moſt pious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſſed
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:119920:102"/>Chriſtians, and of ſo eminent a worth, where he <hi>wiſhes that godly perſon, if ſo;</hi> (If ſo, ſuch is his cenſure upon my naming him under that title) <hi>by entertainment of this opinion, be not like that of the Galatians. Such converſion, is perverſion, &amp;c. and cals for repentance, which I wiſh to that godly man, &amp;c.</hi> It is moſt malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſpoken, he ſhould have proceeded to ſuſpenſion.</p>
               <p>The ſyllogiſme is this, whoſoever beleeves, ſhall be ſaved; But I beleeve; <hi>Ergo,</hi> I ſhall be ſaved; The <hi>minor,</hi> and concluſion, Maſter <hi>Baxter,</hi> and I, ſay, are not ſealed; but the <hi>major</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> oppoſes.</p>
               <p>And firſt he ſaies, the concluſion is ſealed, p. 141, 142. His reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the Sacrament ſeals I ſhal be ſaved in particular,</hi> which he proves at large<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny his argument; for, That I ſhall be ſaved in particular, is either conditionally or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely; That I ſhall be ſaved conditionally, is in the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition, by his owne ground, <hi>The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral includes the particulars,</hi> and his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; As <hi>omnis homo eſt animal,</hi> includes <hi>tu es animal;</hi> So whoſoever beleeves, ſhall be ſaved, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, If I beleeve, I ſhall be ſaved, and that I ſhall be ſaved only conditionally, is all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeales, his owne texts likewiſe prove, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>If thou confeſſe, If thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;</hi> ſo ſtrong is he againſt himſelfe: But that I ſhal be ſaved abſolutely, comes into the concluſion, and that the word ſayes not, nor can it be ſealed. The concluſion, I ſay, is abſolute, and thereupon he pleads. Now if that be ſealed, then not onely whoſoever once receives with faith, muſt needs be certainly ſaved, which you may ſay, you ſee no
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119920:103"/>hurt in, but likewiſe, he that once receives without faith, muſt needs be certainly damned, which God forbid.</p>
               <p>As for his diſtinction, <hi>between the offer of grace, and the promiſe of grace;</hi> he weakly troubles himſelfe, for if the offer be of no other grace, but what is in the promiſe (to wit, pardon and ſalvation as he meanes) I ſay that is promiſed conditionally to all, and me in particular as well as offered.</p>
               <p>And whereas he argues, <hi>Where the condition is performed, there the promiſe is abſolute</hi> I deny it, what is but upon ſuppoſition, is not abſolute. You may ſay, it is as good to me, as if it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, that is, it is certain; (there lyes the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation) but how is it certaine? not abſolutely certain, (as Election is) but conditionally certaine, for the promiſe is ſtill the ſame, and no new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. He proceeds, <hi>But when I beleeve, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is performed; Ergo, the promiſe that I ſhall be ſaved is abſolute. Anſw.</hi> That which aſſures me of a benefit only upon condition, and does not aſſure me the condition, doth not aſſure me abſolutely of the benefit; But the Sacrament aſſures me of ſalvation only on condition I beleeve, but doth not aſſure me I beleeve (as by and by ſhall be cleared) therefore it does not aſſure me abſolutely of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Again, That Propoſition, that contains the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is ſealed, but the <hi>major</hi> contains the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, not the concluſion, therefore the <hi>major,</hi> not the concluſion is ſealed.</p>
               <p>Let this ſuffice, Thy particular intereſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally is contained in the <hi>major</hi> propoſition, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or Covenant, which is ſealed abſolutely; So
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119920:103"/>I remember pleads Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> If others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it is ſealed conditionally, they yet reconcile in a word; As the word Sealing ſignifies ratifying and confirming, and relates to the tenour of the Covenant; It is ſealed abſolutely, that is, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted verity. As ſealing ſignifies exhibiting, conveying, and relates to the benefits of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, It is ſealed conditionally in this ſenſe, that the benefits are conferred only upon condition.</p>
               <p>Page 143. He undertakes the <hi>minor,</hi> Although before, page 128. he tels us, <hi>he knows none ſo ſimple as to aſſert that God doth atteſt our faith;</hi> Yet here, he is growne ſo wiſe to aſſert that God doth ſeal to this propoſition, I beleeve. And thus he argues; <hi>What the Covenant enſures the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeales, but the Covenant aſſures him, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi> His reaſon, <hi>becauſe it gives him evidence in affording the infallible ſignes of faith. Anſw.</hi> You may ſee here how much prejudice will blinde a man. The miſtake is manifeſt, in reckoning that to the <hi>minor,</hi> which belongs to the <hi>major;</hi> for when the word ſaies, If I believe I ſhall be ſaved, it is all one with, If <hi>I receive Chriſt for righteouſneſſe,</hi> and have theſe and theſe marks, whereby it deſcribes this faith to me, all which go to the <hi>major;</hi> now the <hi>minor,</hi> or aſſumption is, But I have theſe marks, ſigns, or that true faith thus deſcribed; And this is no where affirmed to me in the word, and conſequently not ſealed. I will therefore returne his Argument; If the Word or Covenant doth not aſſure me I believe, then this <hi>minor</hi> cannot be ſealed; but this it doth not, for it no where ſaies, I have theſe marks and ſigns; <hi>Ergo.</hi> Again, If it were in the Word, it were an object of faith; but it is no object of faith.

Now as the Articles and Seale aſſure me of ſuch advantages upon the qualification; but it is my proofe and teſtimony, evidence thoſe qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo doth the Covenant and Sacrament aſſure me of ſalvation upon faith, but it is my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſpiritual experience that muſt aſſure my faith; and therefore the Sacrament is not a ſeal of faith (to ratifie and aſſure that) but of the Covenant.</p>

1. That is, Becauſe the <hi>medius terminus</hi> is both in the <hi>major</hi> and the <hi>minor,</hi> therefore whatſoever proves the <hi>major,</hi> muſt prove the <hi>minor.</hi>2. In his owne termes, Though the evidence in <hi>actu ſignato</hi> be in Scripture, this is nothing, ſeeing that goes in the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition; But his Evidence in <hi>actu ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercito</hi> is the buſineſſe of the <hi>minor,</hi> and that is no where, I hope, in Scripture, by his owne confeſſion.3. Whereas, in that Page (128.) before quoted, as here he puts this off with <hi>not interminis, but
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119920:104"/>by conſequence;</hi> Let us ſee his conſequence. <hi>All are ſinners, therefore thou</hi> Roger <hi>art a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; all muſt riſe againe, therefore thou muſt riſe againe.</hi> This is true, becauſe the one includes the other; So, whoſoever beleeves ſhall be ſaved, includes this <hi>de fide.</hi> If thon <hi>Roger</hi> beleeveſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved; but it can never include <hi>de fide,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou <hi>Roger</hi> beleeveſt. He ſayes, yes, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the minor here is the concluſion in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllogiſme,</hi> to wit, He that hath theſe ſigns, beleeves; But I have theſe ſigns, <hi>Ergo,</hi> I beleeve: I anſwer <hi>contrà,</hi> Seeing the concluſion in the Proſyllogiſme is the ſame with the minor in the principall Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme, it cannot be in Scripture, or <hi>de fide,</hi> by the ſame conſequence he proves it can; for, that he hath theſe and theſe ſignes is not in Scripture; but to have theſe and theſe ſignes is all one with to beleeve; <hi>Ergo,</hi> that he beleeves is not in Scripture, or <hi>de fide,</hi> by conſequence. He that hath theſe ſigns, I ſay, is all one with, he that beleeves; and ſo his Proſyllogiſme then, comes effectually but to this, He that beleeves, beleeves; But he beleeves, <hi>ergo,</hi> he beleeves.</p>
               <p>And whereas to illuſtrate this, he ſo elaborately demonſtrates he is a man, <hi>partly by ſence, partly by faith; firſt by a direct nct; and then by a reflect act on the ſigns of his humanity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a man, and therefore ſhall riſe again in the reſurrection; Spectatum admiſſi:</hi> When I am a man, and I beleeve, are propoſitions of equal evidence, Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> argument ſhall carry it. He that is a man, is a man; He that beleeves, beleeves; He that is in the right, is in the right; but Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is in the right, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is in the right.</p>
               <p>Page 146. He raiſes an objection, <hi>The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119920:105"/>ſuppoſes aſſurance: It ſuppoſes I beleeve, but does not evidence that I beleeve;</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is not a ſeale of Faith.</hi> Unto this he can make no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. For my part, I doe neither think the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſuppoſes aſſurance, or effectuall faith, that we muſt needs forbear to come without it. There is a generall faith and acknowledgement of the Goſpell, or Covenant of Jeſus Chriſt, as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means to be ſaved, (I judge) pre-requiſite to adult Church-Memberſhip, and ſo to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which is not to the word that begets it; But as for that Saving Faith, which conſiſts in the prevailing intereſt of the heart for Chriſt, which is the condition of the Covenant (wrought not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies by the Word alone, but by other means with it) It may be engaged to, I ſuppoſe, before it is performed; (and thoſe engagements conduce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) even as in Bonds, a man ſeales to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is to be made, and he is bound before he makes it good.</p>
               <p>There is a manifeſt difference I conceive between what is pre-requiſite to the enjoyment of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the Covenant, and what is pre-requiſite to an engagement to the condition; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is pre-requiſite to enjoy the benefits, but the condition is not abſolutely pre-requiſite to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to the condition; for nothing can be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pre-requiſite to its ſelfe. A juſtifying faith then, I ſay, is <hi>required</hi> of every receiver, as pre-requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to enjoy the benefits, but not abſolutely <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required</hi> to his coming and engaging to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, unleſſe the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 29. man, woman, and child, had a ſaving Faith.</p>
               <p>I have therefore choſe (in my former book,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119920:105"/>
                  <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.) to tender this thus, with humble ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <q>The condition of the Covenant may be conſidered <hi>in eſſe,</hi> as already wrought in us, or <hi>in fieri,</hi> as to be done or performed of us. The receiver ſeales not to his condition neceſſarily <hi>in eſſe,</hi> for children ſeale to the ſame in baptiſm, and the Ordinance is to ſtrengthen the weake that have not aſſurance, and doubt of their Faith. But he ſeales to it <hi>in fieri,</hi> agreeing to the terms of Chriſt propoſed, expecting ſalvation, if ever he have grace to perform his engagements (which he is preſently to goe about) and yeeldeth to be damned (as looking for no other,) if he continue <hi>finally</hi> in an unſound or impenitent condition, which whether he ſeales or no, is ſure however.</q> God forbid but we ſhould endeavour to remove ſuch ſcruples at the very core, if it may be; which for ought I ſee, doe but a little ſerve to reform the bad, but doe very much help to deject many ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſerious Chriſtians, in their more free and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged approaches unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As for his diſcourſe that follows, p, 147 (which yet quite waves the ſtrength in hand) he is much plunged; <hi>As the Sacrament</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>is a means of grace, ſo it is a means of aſſurance; now the Sacrament is not a means of initiall Grace, but of progreſſive, &amp;c.</hi> I pray mark it, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion that ariſes from theſe two prem ſes muſt needs be this, <hi>Ergo.</hi> the Sacrament is not a means of initial, but progreſſive aſſurance. Yet be pleaſed to look but a few lines lower, and he tels us, <hi>The Sacrament is ſometimes the means of initiall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, though ordinarily of progreſſive.</hi> This is the logick, whereto the man ſtill ſo highly pretends. I will therefore now returne upon him;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119920:106"/>As the Sacrament is a means of aſſurance, ſo is it a means of grace: But the Sacrament is ſometimes a means of initiall aſſurance; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Sacrament, is ſometimes (if not ordinarily) a means of initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Grace, or effectuall converſion. The <hi>major</hi> converſe is his own; the <hi>minor</hi> alſo is expreſſely his own. If theſe be true, How will he deny my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion? And whereas he ſpeaks ſome things well, as to the manner how the Sacrament encreaſes grace, and aſſurance; Let the judicious conſider, what hurt there can be upon ſome of his pleas, to hold that initiall Faith, Love, Repentance, Aſſurance, may be wrought by it, through the Spirit of God, as well as progreſſive? If further degrees in the ſame kind, why not the ſame kind it ſelf? Seeing we attribute nothing here <hi>operi operato,</hi> to the worke done, but <hi>gratiae operanti,</hi> and neither the one nor the other (the firſt ſeed or increaſe) is exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>per modum obſignationis,</hi> but excited, or wrought, <hi>proponendo objectum, morali actione, &amp; mediante ſignificatione,</hi> that is, no otherwiſe then reall Grace is both begotten and confirmed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Page 148. He is pious and healing; and it cals to my remembrance that ſuitable, and ſweet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction he makes uſe of, p. 99. <hi>Want of grace, is either ſenſible, or inſenſible.</hi> Let me beſeech the tender Chriſtian not to forget this, and be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged utterly in the fight of his wants to come unto Chriſt, but rather know, the ſenſe of thy unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, which thou makeſt a bolt to ſhut out Chriſt, ſhould be a latch to open to him; for both thy need is the greater, and his pitty the more. <hi>Thou maiſt come to the Sacrament</hi> (he tels thee here) <hi>with the Prophets feare, I am
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119920:106"/>undone, yet mayest go away with this aſſurance, Thy iniquity is taken away, and ſin purged.</hi> For this, we thank him, and if a man may come as <hi>loft, Luk</hi> 19.10. <hi>and undone,</hi> then may he come while he <hi>judges</hi> and humbles <hi>himſelfe,</hi> though he is in doubt of his regeneration.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point of ſealing; If any are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to contend about termes, I ſhall not contend with them. For
1. If you will ſay, the Sacrament is a ſeale of faith metaphorically, as it does <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutivè,</hi> in the effect confirm (that is increaſe) Faith, ſo as all other graces are ſealed, and all other Ordinances may bee ſaid ſeales, You may.2. If you will ſay, it is a ſeale of Faith <hi>objectivè,</hi> becauſe the main object of the Covenant is ſealed, as we uſually hold faith juſtifies; In this ſenſe, I ſhould like it, and would argue, If it be thus a ſeale of Faith, then is it not a ſeal of Experience, nor Reaſon. But the <hi>minor</hi> and concluſion aforeſaid is one of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, the other of Reaſon, and the <hi>major</hi> onely of Faith.3. If you ſay it is a ſeale to Faith, as the condition required to the benefits; This is true, no mans intereſt is ſealed but conditionally.4. If you call it a ſeale to Faith, as a man is ſaid to ſeale to his own part (that is, engages to it) In all this you may uſe your liberty. But if you ſay it is a ſeale of Faith <hi>ſubjective,</hi> properly to confirm and ratifie Faith; or any way ſo to aſſure, or evidence Faith, that God ſhall be made to ſet his ſeale to a lye, if any come without a Saving Faith: This muſt be denyed, and rejected, and anſwered, that the Sacrament is not thus a ſeale of Faith (to wit formally, directly, properly) but of the Covenant, unto which it is ſet, as to an undoubted and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table truth, and as a ſtanding ſeale for the Church,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119920:107"/>as firme and irrefiagable, as if it were in adamant; Againſt which, Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> arguments become but as earthen ware, or <hi>the veſſels of a potter,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, while he ſtriks at me, they <hi>break</hi> themſelves <hi>in peeces,</hi> ſo that here is ſcarce to be <hi>found in the burſting of them,</hi> ſo much as <hi>a ſhard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withall, out of the pit.</hi>

Hereof we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh; There are thoſe to whom it belongs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard to the publication, tender, and a kind of potentiall intereſt if they come in, and thus it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all even without the Church: And there are thoſe to whom it belongs by way of actuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and priviledge in it as Covenanters, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. and thus it belongs to all within the Church and them only. Now this priviledge is either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or according to title; or inward, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the effectuall benefits thereof. The ſtate of my Anſwer then lyes plainly, that all thoſe to whom the Covenant belongs by way of intereſt in it, though but according to title, are in Covenant ſo far as the externall ſeale belongs to them, without ſome known bar otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>As for the prejudice here Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would raiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, it will not gaine his cauſe ſo much with <hi>the many,</hi> as it will looſe it with the wiſe. All hee
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119920:107"/>has to anſwer, is this, Page 149. <hi>The Sacrament indeed belongs conditionally to all, but onely to the worthy Receivers abſolutely: Anſw.</hi>
1 If there be any ſenſe and validity in this, he muſt argue thus, The Sacrament is nor to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to all it belongs conditionally, but to thoſe only to whom it belongs abſolutely; but it belongs only to the worthy Receiver abſolutely; therefore it muſt be delivered only to the worthy Receiver. Now this you ſee is apparently falſe, ſeeing he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſome only viſibly worthy, to whom he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe counts it belongs not abſolutely.2 The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of every man in the benefits of the Covenant, and ſo in the Sacrament (as we now ſpeak) I have proved already is conditional, and not abſolute.3 The diſtinction then, that might beſt ſerve our turns, or accommodate us here, as I imagine, were of an actual and potential (inward) intereſt, both conditional; for the abſolute Covenant is ſecret, and belongs only to God.</p>
               <p>Page 150. <q>Whereas I ſuppoſe a man now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to ingage with Chriſt on his own termes, yet not effectually in Covenant with him, and ſay the Sacrament belongs to him (as the likelieſt means, I judge, to root and eſtabliſh him)</q> he fils his mouth with theſe terms, <hi>Come you Drunkards, Whore-maſters, Muderers, and all you Rabble of hell, here is doctrine for you, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> Truly I think here were rather fit language for them; It is pity, but the Doctor, before he had left his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Phyſick, had taken a vomit to rid his ſtomach of this bitter humour, and ill language which little becomes a Miniſter of Chriſt. As for the contradiction herein, he would faſten upon me, I pray look page 191. and he diſtinguiſhes
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:119920:108"/>for me; <hi>A good reſolution</hi> (to wit to ſubmit to the government of Chriſt) <hi>is either Legal, or Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical; a Legal is antecedent to faith,</hi> &amp;c. I pray note it, and if a man may have a good reſolution (to wit Legal) before ſaith, why muſt this be an abſurdity in me, to ſay he may have the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is in Covenant? why doth the man ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himſelfe? The truth is, he is too narrow in the ſpeaking of theſe things. A man may be ſo under the previous operations of the Spirit of grace, as not only to reſolve, but <hi>enter Covenant,</hi> Deut. 29.12. <hi>returne, remember God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire early</hi> (to wit, in good earneſt for the time) <hi>after him, Pſal.</hi> 78.34, 35. and yet his heart be not <hi>right and ſtedfaſt in it,</hi> v. 37. Thus the Scriptures ſpeak often, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.3.5.20, &amp;c. and thus are they interpreted by the Orthodox <hi>Reynolds</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. p. 316.</p>
               <p>Page 157. He likewiſe puzzles himſelf about my meaning, <hi>how the Covenant belongs to all, and yet not the benefits,</hi> then concludes (as even now, and as he ſtill uſes) <hi>it muſt be a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> becauſe he does not conceive it. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Covenant is taken either for the condition (that is the duty) Thus it belongs to all; or for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits (the reward, by grace through Chriſt, of the duty) Thus it belongs to thoſe onely that have the condition, or are in Chriſt; or for the tenour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, or rather reſulting out of both from the ſanction of ſuch a reward to the duty; That which reſults out of both, and is neither the one alone, nor the other, muſt be a third; And this is no other then the grace of the Goſpel, which brings <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto all men,</hi> and ſo belongs to all, even the whole world, ſo far, that they have <hi>potentially,</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:119920:108"/>as the Church hath actually, a <hi>conditional</hi> (outward and inward) concernment in it. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> I perceive is forced to take a great deal of pains to make my expreſſions diſagree, where there is no quarrel; but I need onely now and the bring the ſeverall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his book in ſight of one another, and they fall together by the eares of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
               <p>Page 152, 153.

               <p>The firſt is, Children, and the diſtracted again, which is ſeventeen times.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> The ſixth Objection is, <hi>The Sacrament is onely for the Regenerate; it is no converting Ordinance;</hi> and this is made to ſerve upon all occaſions.</p>
               <p>For my anſwer to this, Although I judge there is not ſuch ſtrength herein, as is ſuppoſed; for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Ordinance is appointed for the Church, and every member of age is bound to frequent it, and prepare for it: It is not the conſideration whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will convert or not, can be brought in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the command of Chriſt. If God command an unregenerate man to give almes, he is not to queſtion whether it be converting or no, but to do his duty, though during that eſtate, he is ſure to ſinne in it; ſo is it in this caſe, and all others; It is not the event can be the rule of our obedience. It is true Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſtillurges, An unregenerate man muſt hear and pray; though he ſins in them, be cauſe it will convert him; but he muſt not receive, for that will not convert him. Now conſider this, and if there be validity in it, here lyes the point with him; A man muſt not do that wherein he ſhal ſin, if it will do him no good; but he may do that wherein he ſins, ſo long as it will be beneficial to him. Thus would mortal man, who is but duſt, advance his benefit above divine authority; and as if he were his own rule and end, make void Gods precept, through his tradition.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, whereas I am perſwaded that there is no man, but ſo far as he does his duty, it ſhall tend to his good, which as I know may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies accrue to him, though it doth not convert him, ſo do I think, that ordinarily while men wait upon God in their duties of piety and charity, though they are no <hi>cauſes,</hi> yet are they <hi>the way,</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:119920:109"/>wherein God doth meet them with his effectual grace, not through any ſpecial promiſe, for there is no ſuch (we hold) to any works before faith, but ſome general offers, and through the goodneſſe of his nature, the cauſe, and ground of all thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which is therefore a firm rock to build upon (a point I think very fit to be conſidered) I have thought good to deliver my opinion, that I deny not through Jeſus Chriſt, but a poore ſinner, who examines himſelfe, and ſo comes to him in the ſight his condition, may finde this Ordinance an effectual means to beget grace in him, as well as encreaſe it.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſſe I am heartily ſorry to ſee what prejudice (or it is my weakneſſe ſo to think) hath gotten on the ſpirits of many godly men, meerly upon the terms of a ſealing Ordinance, an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance for nouriſhment, confirmation, and the like, which terms do indeed reſpect the viſible Church, or our incorporation in it, and ſo make for us. I ſhal therefore now return my anſwer in this manner; When Jeſus Chriſt aſcended to heaven, he left order to procure him a Church; To this end, he appointed a Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors; This Miniſterial commiſſion contained two things, the gathering together of the Saints, and edification of the body of Chriſt; This body or Church, is either viſible or inviſible; The inviſible conſiſts only of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and the Elect; The viſible conſiſts of al that are gathered together in profeſſion of his name; and unto the Church in this capacity doth the office of the Miniſtry appertain, as I judge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly. Now according to this double work hereof, we diſtinguiſh of the Ordinances to effect
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:119920:110"/>it. There is the gathering Ordinance, for the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or calling of the Nations, or to convert the Heathen unto the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt; and this is the Goſpell, or Word, whereby men are made Diſciples incompleatly, and compleatly by baptiſm. And there are ordinances for Edification of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy brought into the profeſſion of him, and thoſe are all the other Ordinances together with the Word. The Apoſtle ſpeakes to this point, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they call on him whom they have not beleeved, or beleeve without hearing, and a preacher?</hi> The converting Ordinance here, to bring men to the Chriſtian faith, is preaching; being brought to this faith and knowledge of the true God they are <hi>to call upon him, and they ſhall be ſaved, v.</hi> 13 Now Prayer then is an edifying Ordinance, for if a Heathen pray before he comes to know the true God, it is flat idolatry, and <hi>Godwil not give his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to another.</hi> And as prayer is an edifying Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſo is the Sacrament, and no otherwiſe. My Anſwer then now, to the Objection fals directly thus; It is true, the Sacrament is not the gathering Ordinance, to bring in the Nations to the doctrine of Chriſt, or an Ordinance to convert the Heathen; It is not appointed to that end (which is the right notion of this diſtinction, I think, as ſure as there ought to be any) but it is an Ordinance for Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the viſible Church, wherein there being ſome members that are unregenerate (and that the moſt, I fear) as it ſerves to edifie them, it muſt be a means of their regeneration. And as for my part, I am perſwaded the ſerious exerciſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace, the confirming and encreaſing thereof, and that hereby, is the way of Gods own working ſpeciall grace alſo, yet moſt freely, as is ſuitable to the nature of it.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:119920:110"/>
               <p>There are two things ſeem to me clear in the Goſpel.
1. That the ſame faith which ſerved to admit men to be Church-members, ſerved to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to the Communion.2. That a Faith that fals ſhort of ſaving (to wit, the very receiving of the Apoſtles doctrine) ſerved to make men Diſciple and adde them to the Church. From which foundation, I appeale to the Judicious, for the ſolidity of that diſtinction of an outward and inward converſion; which under favour I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe thus, There is a converſion of aſſent, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in God and Jeſus Chriſt, in oppoſition to all other Religions (which alone reaches ſo far as to engage one to the Covenant) and this I take it, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily pre requiſite to adult Church member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and both the Sacraments. And there is a converſion of conſent, in the imbracing this God, as our cheifeſt good, and accepting of Jeſus Chriſt, as our Lord and Saviour, ſo as to prefer his intereſt in our hearts above the fleſh. World, and Devill; and this converſion, though it is required (as it is, to the right performance of every ſaving duty) yet is not neceſſarily pre-required to the Sacraments, or Church-communion. Indeed I think, as to the duty hereof a man may and is, to engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before it is performed; (yet ſo, or in ſuch terms, as the tendereſt ſpirits may not be brought in fear of a lye) but as to the Grace it ſelfe, as it is the Free Gift of God, the moſt of our members may not yet have attained, it is the firſt or cheife part of their edification, wrought in them alone by the Holy Spirit, very ſecretly and variouſly, in ſome more ſuddenly, in others I beleeve with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many and long previous operations, whereunto he uſes all his Ordinances as means, together

               <p>The ſame Faith the Scripture requires unto the Sacraments, it requires unto Prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12, 13, 14. now though an effectual Faith be required, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6. to pray ſavingly, yet is it not pre-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but a man that is but outwardly converted to the knowledge of Chriſt, may, and muſt waite upon God in prayer, and that as a means (I judge) in the exerciſe of his common grace, to obtaine ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, through the grace of God. The ſame I ſay of the Sacrament, and do conclude, whereas our Divines doe give it the denomination of a confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or edifying Ordinance, it is to be taken in regard of the viſible Church, and not in regard of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as if none could have effectual grace wrought by them, <hi>Vera adoptio</hi> (ſaies <hi>Chemnitius in Har. Evan. in Lu. cap.</hi> 1.) <hi>ex mera gratia donaour, quando ſpiritu ſuo per verbum</hi> &amp; Sacramenta, <hi>fidem in nobis efficit quâ Christum recipimus per quem regeneramur.</hi> It were not hard I think to quote good Divines very ordinarily preſcribing the Sacrament with other Ordinances, as the means for obtaining the Spirit, Grace. Faith, &amp;c. to thoſe that want it; and I do not think their practiſe herein rowed againſt their Judgement.</p>
               <p>For the clearer knowledge whereof I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this paſſage (in <hi>Edit.</hi> 3.) <q>There is two things in the Sacrament, a ſignification, which they have certaine from the Inſtitution; and an Exhibition and Obſignation, which moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that they may not make them <hi>nuda ſigna,</hi> do more diſputably attribute to them. There is likewiſe double grace; <hi>Relative Grace,</hi> which
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:119920:112"/>makes a change onely in our ſtate and relation, and <hi>Reall Grace,</hi> which changes the heart; and it is either the infuſion of the firſt grace in the habits or root, for converſion, or increaſe thereof in the acts or fruit for confirmation. Now the Sacraments are means of Grace two waies, Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of Conveyance, <hi>ratione hujus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignationis;</hi> or by way of moral Operation <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap> ſignificationis.</hi> In the firſt reſpect (which yet ſome hardly credit) they are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Relative Grace,</hi> exhibiting the benefits of the Covenant upon its condition, as already performed (whenſoever wrought) in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and convert not; but in the other reſpect, as they are (more undoubtedly <hi>ex instituto</hi>) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſignifying and holding forth the death of Chriſt (and alſo the Covenant ſealed) by way of moral operation on the intelligent, they are means of Real Grace, that is, they are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in the hands of Gods Spirit, to work on the hearts of whom he pleaſes, either in infuſing the ſeed, or producing a growth of it in them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now let me beſeech the pious and wiſe to lay this to heart, and conſider it; If I ſhould hold the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments confer grace <hi>phyſically,</hi> whether Real or Relative, it were groſſe, and belongs to the doctrine of <hi>opus operatum.</hi> If I ſhould hold they convey regeneration, or any Real grace, <hi>morally,</hi> by way of <hi>obſignation,</hi> I judge it were as injudicious and unſound; for moral inſtruments cannot exhibit any thing real (but onely a right to it) and the firſt grace belongs to the abſolute Covenant, not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, which is ſealed. But whereas I hold only they beget grace (in the intelligent) no otherwiſe then they increaſe it, that is, by way of moral action
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:119920:113"/>
                  <hi>per modum objecti,</hi> as grace is ſtill both begotten, and confirmed in other Ordinances; It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, there is no danger here of advancing this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance above its nature, or condition; but there is very much danger, of being injurious to poore Chriſtians; of diſ-valuing this means of Grace, the ſweet Jeſus has appointed us; of bringing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, how it can beget any degrees of grace at all, if it cannot the firſt; and eſpecially of being very preſumptuous with the Spirit of God, to goe to limit him in the very ſame way he ordinarily works the ſame effect, in his other Ordinances.</p>
               <p>To come now to Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> oppoſition. p. 154. He firſt tels us, <hi>Some Divines indeed do hold Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be a means of Regeneration, but they ſhould not, and he does not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I agree with him, as for Infants; But for the Intelligent, <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm may convince him, whom we find admitting all to it and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to amendment, as the uſe (or end) of it; and therfore it is not ſaid, they repented unto bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, but they were baptiſed unto repentance. The end cannot precede what is in order to it, and the effect <hi>in eſſe,</hi> be before the cauſe in <hi>operari.</hi> And as for his inſtances in the <hi>Acts,</hi> That faith was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed, It is anſwered, That is an hiſtoricall faith, onely accepting the doctrine of Chriſt, and profeſſion thereof, as is beyond diſpute (to me) in <hi>Simon Magus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. Ibid. <hi>In regeneration the Word is writ in our hearts, and can any man make the ſeal a cauſe of the writing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He may as well aske, can any writing be a cauſe of it ſelfe? But here is the mans error ſtill, The ſeale of the inward writing in mens hearts is not
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:119920:113"/>the Sacraments, but the Spirit, and that ſeale I hope, is the cauſe of the writing, and that by the means of the outward writing and ſeale, the Word and Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Page 155. He produces my Argument, <q>The Sacrament, is a viſible Goſpel; the ſhewing forth the death of Chriſt is the means of converſion; But the Sacrameut is a ſhewing forth of his death.</q> 
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi> His Anſwer is, <hi>This proves onely, that all may be preſent</hi> (which he pleads for) <hi>not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally receive. Anſw.</hi> Methinks the heart of a godly man ſhould at firſt ſcare ſerve him, thus to ſhift, and trifle with this holy Ordinanee, and the Conſciences of people. And yet his granting this is enough, for ſo long as he maintains, that as the Sacrament holds forth Chriſt to the eyes, there is none may be debarred from the ſight, no more then they may be debarred from hearing, where he is held forth to the eare. I argue, Then as Chriſt is held forth Sacramentally to the taſte and touch, there is none can be debarred (to wit, if intelligent Church-members) from the taſting and feeling of him herein, then they can from the ſeeing of him, or hearing: Nay, our force for this is rather grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe the words of inſtitution expreſſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the touch and taſte, while Chriſt ſaies <hi>this is my body,</hi> not barely to ſee, and hear, but to <hi>take, and eate.</hi> As the Centurion by looking on Chriſt upon the croſſe, beleeved he was the Son of God, So did <hi>Thomas</hi> by feeling his wounds, beleeve his Reſurrection; And I doe not doubt but that all theſe ſenſes doe afford their grounds of ſuitable meditation, about the melting objects of Chriſts Paſſion, Redemption, and tender mercies ſo repreſented, they may become means to worke
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:119920:114"/>upon us through the Spirit of God, which we may piouſly hope for by vertue of an Ordinance. For if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſay (Page 147.) <hi>What the word ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies by one ſenſe, the Sacrament doth by all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and therefore is a more powerful means of aſſurance;</hi> I will not doubt to ſay by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as it applies the ſame thing with the word, it may have the ſame operation, and as faith comes into the heart at firſt in the one, by hearing alone, it may in the other, by hearing ſeeing, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taſting altogether.</p>
               <p>Page 156. He brings in my next Argument; <q>In the inſtitution there is a <hi>Take and Eat; a Take,</hi> for ſuch as have not Chriſt, a word of grace to quicken thoſe, as <hi>an Eat</hi> to nouriſh others.</q> My ſubſtance is, Here is a free offer and command in this word <hi>Take,</hi> and we are not to hold it ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. He excepts, <hi>Taking and Eating call for acts of faith, and preſuppoſe the habit. Anſ.</hi> When Chriſt and his Diſciples preached, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and repent, The command did call for faith, and repentance, but I hope it did not preſuppoſe the habit in thoſe who were to be converted; ſo when Chriſt ſayes here <hi>Take,</hi> that gracious word includes <hi>Beleeve,</hi> or receive me by faith; but faith I hope is required, where it is not pre-required, to wit, required that it may be wrought as well as acted. And herein indeed I place my ſtrength; This <hi>Take</hi> requires <hi>Beleeve,</hi> but there is a vertue or power from Chriſt that goes along with his commands; The free tenders of himſelfe, are the conveyances of the grace he requires to the receiving him; even as the Apoſtles words to the Jaylor (<hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. which he well notes) <hi>Beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> was the inſtrument to worke
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:119920:114"/>that faith, and convert him; And as while <hi>Thomas,</hi> by feeling Chriſts wounds, beleeved, why might it not be the vertue of Chriſts gracious command, bidding him to put his fingers in his ſides, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that produced that powerful application, <hi>My Lord, and my God?</hi> Now we have Chriſt here likewiſe, preſenting his broken body and blood; and bidding us feel his wounds, touch, and taſte, <hi>Take, and eat,</hi> be not faithleſſe but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving. Here we have a joynt offer and command; and why then ſhould we diſtruſt the power of our Lord, when we have the word of our Lord? What if we had but that one word for us, were not one word from the mouth of our deare Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which is a ſtanding word to his Church, enough to reſt upon? Truly Chriſtians, Let me plead with you: Are the words of Chriſt <hi>Spirit and life,</hi> or are they not? Is there any power goes along with the tender offers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Goſpel, or is there not? If there be not, why do poor dead ſouls wait on them for life? If there be, then why is there not the like power expected in this precept, and offer of grace? How dull and flow of heart are we to relye upon Chriſt, and expect vertue from his commands? Methinks I could wiſh, that all faithful Miniſters would ſet themſelves to beleeve in Chriſt for this effect, and while they ſhould as it were ſtand round about this little word <hi>Take,</hi> by their acting faith in Chriſt, and expectations from him, as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples did about <hi>Paul</hi> when they ſuppoſed him ſtoned dead, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. though they judge no otherwiſe of this word, though <hi>they ſuppoſe it,</hi> but a <hi>dead word</hi> to the unregenerate, they might finde life in it, for the quickning of their flocks,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119920:115"/>(as ſome have) and comfort of their labours. <hi>If you will not beleeve, ſurely you ſhall not bee eſtabliſhed.</hi>

               <p>Page 157, 158. He objects three or foure things againſt this: I <hi>But we have neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor preſident of bleſſing the command of Taking in the Sacrament, as we have of bleſſing the word preached in order to converſion. Anſw.</hi>
1. God hath promiſed in general to meet with thoſe that wait on him in his wayes; and where is there any text that denyes this bleſſing here? If there be none, it is but a ſad thing to diſtruſt God.2 Doe we not know that Jeſus Chriſt did conſecrate this Ordinance with a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing? Now is not Chriſts own action herein as good as any promiſe, or all preſidents, and who can limit that bleſſing to one member above another, or tye up the Spirit of God?3 I pray ſee over leafe, and himſelfe tels us well, <hi>This Take is a ſhort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and virtual Sermon;</hi> Now what a thing is this, to demand a promiſe and preſident to prove that the Exhortation and Sermon of Chriſt is converting? Is not the <hi>Word</hi> converting? And is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s word leſſe converting, becauſe it is Chriſts? Alas Sirsl the caſe is even clear, and the grand Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is unbeleef.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>But the word is both ſeed and food, not the Sacrament. Anſw.</hi>
1 Who knows not that the very being and operation of the Sacrament conſiſts through the word; and indeed the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have in it, well conſidered, is onely by the implicite vertue thereof; By which ſame kind of working, may the firſt grace, as cleerly, as any farther degrees, be wrought by it.2 The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is both ſeed and food too, for here is a <hi>Take,</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:119920:115"/>and this is certainly ſeed, as a word of grace from Chriſt; and here is an <hi>Eat,</hi> including food.3 Prayer is no where called the immortal ſeed, yet is it ſeed, I doubt not, in this ſenſe, to beget grace in us.4. <hi>Ex quibus naſcimur, ex i is nutrimur, That which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes us, can beget us,</hi> is a principle ſo true, that out the ſame food that goes to the aliment of our owne bodies, doth ariſe the matter, for our childrens generations.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>But ſuppoſe a man ſtouts it out before, and after the word Take, if actuall receiving can convert him, the Apoſtles rule is not univerſally true. He that eats unworthily eats judgement to himſelfe. Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe the Jaylor had ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it out againſt that word <hi>Beleeve;</hi> had he like to have been converted, if he had not been converted? what a queſtion were this? The truth is, Theſe diſ-junctive ſuppoſals are but vaine and evil: And therefore I ſhall only fore warn tender conſciences to take heed of that <hi>Dilemma</hi> that lurks here; He that receives worthily is converted already; He that receives not worthily eats his damnation. Let us rather perſwade our ſelves;
1 That a man may be in a ſtate of unregeneracy, &amp; in that ſenſe <hi>unworthy,</hi> yet may hear, pray, or receive <hi>worthily</hi> in his kind (<hi>in ſuo genere</hi>) when he is ſo wrought on by it, as to make a ſaving uſe thereof; for it ſeems not to me ſo tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to ſay, a man heard unworthily when he was converted by it.2 There is a general eating dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as the unregenerate <hi>in ſenſu compoſito</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that eſtate, ſinnes in hearing, praying, and in all he doth; and ſo this is cleerly anſwered, with other duties; or there is a particular eating dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or judgement in the Apoſtles ſenſe, and that judgement he ſpeaks of; appears to be thoſe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:119920:116"/>temporal judgements which were brought upon the <hi>Corinths,</hi> not for their coming to the Sacrament in an unregenerate eſtate, but for their not putting a difference between this ſacred Table, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, (that is, uſed it not as a holy inſtitution) which is the direct meaning of both thoſe phraſes, eating unworthily, and not diſcerning the Lords body, which expound one another, or not for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe of unregeneracy, but an unworthineſſe of prophanation.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>But ſuppoſe a man may be converted by that ſhort exhortation, and virtual Sermon, Take, That may be done by bare preſence, &amp;c. Anſ.</hi> If all come to this ſtill, you may ſee what he muſt have, <hi>A Sacrament without receiving,</hi> which yet himſelfe decryes. When Chriſt ſayes, Take, it is to this end, to eat, and who dare ſeparate Chriſts end from his action? Let this ſuffice, we have here both words, <hi>Take and Eat,</hi> for our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and we need not doubt, but all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental actions doe as it were, in a kinde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of proprieties, interweave their vertue in working upon each man according to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>When God commands us to make us new hearts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23. he tels us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Ez.</hi> 11.19. <hi>I will put a new heart in you;</hi> ſo Chriſt bids us <hi>Take.</hi> Yet faith is the gift of God; Now then Man is to wait on his duty, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a power in Chriſts precept. For my part, let others look on this word onely as an empty live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe word; I ſhall endeavour to let it ſinke in my heart: And though I am a poor unworthy ſinner, that am not ſure I have faith enough to ſave my ſoul (the Lord increaſe it) yet methinks I doe ſo
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:119920:116"/>pathetically beleeve the goodneſſe and ſweerneſſe of Chriſt, that I dare lay my life on it, he would never have ſo indeterminately commanded, <hi>Drinks you all of it,</hi> if ſo many thouſands of unregenerate members that come thither, muſt but neceſſarily thereby eat their damnation. I muſt confeſſe, I doe ever ſuſpect my owne weakneſſe, and am tenderly afraid left I ſhould ewe, and hurt others; (and therefore I beſeech every Soul to look well to the word, and his owne conſcience, and truſt nothing on me) yet doe I finde amidſt the doubts and fears of my ſpirit, a ſweet melting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of my thoughts, in this anſwer, which I muſt make unto my Saviour, when he calls me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for what I have writ. Lord here is expreſly thy command, and I durſt not nullifie it to any that are capable of it; Here is thy tender offer of grace, <hi>Take,</hi> and I durſt not bring up any ſuch hard thoughts on thy wayes to fright men from thee. And now I am aſſured, Lord, thou wilt as freely forgive me if I place too much truſt, or would raiſe too much confidence on thy bare word, as thou wilt forgive others, if they place too little in it. For though the Fleſh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet the Spirit quickneth, and thy words are ſpirit and life.</p>
               <p>Page 159. <q>He brings in this inſtance of mine; Suppoſe a moral Chriſtian, who cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, prepares himſelfe and ſo comes, ſhall the Sacrament be neceſſarily fruitleſſe to him?</q> He anſwers, <hi>not withſtanding all his preparatory acts, he comes to the feaſt without the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <q>Doing his beſt; you muſt take them in his kinde, as of the regenerate in his kinde.</q> And whereas he thinks I attribute too much to a few dead acts of a natural man, he miſtakes; for I attribute all to the power of Chriſts command, and the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his quickning grace in the uſe of the means.</p>
               <p>Page 160. <hi>Actual receiving is no act of God, but of the creature, and an outward act too, and therefore hath not a converting power in it. Anſw.</hi> A very mature and digeſted Argument!

               </p>

               <p>Page 168. As for his exceptions againſt our diſtinction of an outward and effectuall converſion, the right conceiving the terms onely may ſatisfie, and I will explain my ſelfe thus: In the ſoule there is two faculties, the Underſtanding, and the Will; There is accordingly a double converſion, either unto the things which before we did not know, or to the right improvement of the things we do know; or there is a converſion to a ſincere Religion, or to be ſincere in our Religion. The firſt of theſe muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be wrought by teaching onely, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive Arguments, unleſſe by miracle; but when we once are informed by the word, then do all the other Ordinances conduce to bring that knowledge into the heart and life; So that here does likewiſe ariſe that other diſtinction of mine, of the principall converting Ordinance, and ſubordinate, which work by vertue thereof. Now if you will ſuppoſe a heathen ſufficiently knowing, in the myſteries of our Religion, I doe not doubt but this ſolemnity were
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:119920:119"/>
                  <hi>apta uata</hi> to convert him, becauſe it ſhewes or holds forth that which is a means of Converſion. But theſe two things we muſt know as ſure;
1 That it cannot beget any aſſent, or reverential apprehenſions, but upon ſuppoſition of the vertue of the principal Ordinance; to wit, that he is informed (before, or at preſent) in the meaning hereof; For this bare knowledge alone, is that which is neither encreaſed nor begotten by the Sacrament, but the Word onely, that inſtructs us about it.2 That God hath not appointed it for this uſe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily commanded, that every man ſhall be firſt initiated in the Church by Baptiſme before he communicates, <hi>No uncircumciſed perſon ſhall eat thereof.</hi> And here is anſwered thoſe two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, page 163. which ſhew you how low Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is brought, <hi>If the Sacrament can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, how dare Mr.</hi> H. <hi>exclude Infants</hi> (which is eighteen times) <hi>and heathens?</hi> I anſwer, becauſe it converts by a joynt vertue of the word, and diſcernment, which children have not; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the unbaptiſed (which is the caſe of heathen) are forbid to eat thereof, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40.</p>
               <p>And now at laſt, if you will bring the point even with the ſame in Baptiſme of Infants, and doe nothing but urge upon me for an expreſſe text where this Sacrament is ordained to this end to convert any; I will demand of you firſt, an expreſſe Text, where it is inſtituted for Edification (which yet by cleer argument you may ſhew) and when you have produced that, I will manifeſtly ſhew you;
1 That this Edification refers to the viſible body, Saints by calling, or the whole Church.2 That there are many unregenerate members
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119920:119"/>among them; and then I demand how it can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to edifie members, if it be not a means of begetting grace in ſome, as encreaſing it in others? As for the terme (this word) <hi>Edification</hi> it is cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly common to the viſible Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that when an unbeleever comes in amongſt them, verſ. 23. All things are ſaid yet to be done unto edifying, verſ. 27. What Miniſter doth not pray ordinarily for his whole people that they may be <hi>edified?</hi> Church-cenſures are for Edification (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10.) but I hope it is not the regenerate onely are cenſured. We need look no further then <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19. and 15.2. the word is ſo ordinary, that what is done for our neighbours good, is ſaid to be for his <hi>edification.</hi>

Mr.H. <hi>makes confirmation of the Covenant a primary end, confirmation of our faith a ſecondary end of the Lords Supper; I wiſh he did not ſhew himſelfe, as little skilled in morality, as in Logick</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> One would verily thinke here, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſure, was in ſome great abſurdity, by this mans language; but will you be pleaſed to turne to Mr. <hi>D.</hi> himſelfe, page 126. <hi>The Sacrament</hi> (ſayes he there) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to things, and thus as ſeals, firſt they confirm the Covenant;</hi> Secondly, <hi>they confirme faith.</hi> I pray marke it; And is it not worth your notice; how <hi>much he is skilled</hi> in Logick, Morality, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and what not? that can finde you out a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between my Primary, and Secondary, and his Firſt and Second? It is even pity ſo ſamous a man ſhould forget all his learning here, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:119920:120"/>thus at me, for ſaying the ſame thing he doth; nay the ſame thing, the truth, and others doe with us: For let me helpe him out here, There is the <hi>end of the Ordainer,</hi> and the <hi>end of the Ordinance;</hi> It may be true, that the Churches Edification, is primarily in the intention of the Ordainer, but the primary end of the Ordinance, muſt be that which goes into the Inſtitution, and the ſecondary that which flows from it: Now the end that is thus expreſſe in the Inſtitution is, for to be a memorial of Chriſts death, or the Covenant by his death, and ſo outwardly to ſeale, ſolemnize, or confirm the Covenant, and then the confirming a mans faith (as begetting it in others) is plainly a conſequent effect, reſult, or concomitant thereof. By this one paſſage well conſidered, you may have a gueſſe at the man.</p>
               <p>As for his following exceptions from page 171. to the end of the Objection, where he carps at me, for putting in the whole duty of the receiver, both before, and after, as well as In receiving (and what practical Divine doth not tell us of awakening the vertue of the Sacrament by after-meditations) page 172, 173. And for that phraſe, <hi>Baptized into the Church,</hi> which I take to be a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of being baptized into Chriſt, page 174. And for thoſe termes of a general faith, Doing a mans beft, &amp;c, they are not worth any farther notice: So likewiſe where he ſnarles at my allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, page 175. in that word, (belongs) <hi>The harveſt belongs not to the Reapers, but to Boaz himſelfe:</hi> And that other (penitently inclined) which yet I purpoſely picked out inſtead of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, &amp;c. what pitiful poore things are they, as if he envied me barely an expreſſion? even as <hi>Leah</hi>

               <p>Waving therefore theſe letts, I ſhall proceed to gather together my Arguments to prove the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>actual receiving</hi> (which is the thing only he oppoſes) a means of the unregenerates edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and conſequently his effectual converſion. And they amount to twelve, beſides the chiefe of my laſt booke, as it is <hi>verbum viſibile,</hi> with others, the Reader may finde out himſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is the duty of every intelligent member to frequent the Sacrament; but <hi>officium, eſt propter beneficium; Ergo,</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> here indeed doth moſt ſadly, and without ground argue, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament cannot doe an unregenerate man good, but certaine hurt, therefore it is not his duty. The weakneſſe whereof is manifeſt, becauſe
1 It is not mans benefit, but Gods precept, is the ground of duty.2 A thing is not good, and our duty, and therefore God wills it, but God wills it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good, and our duty. But wee argue (I take it) firmly againſt him; It is his duty (the duty I have proved good in my fifth Reaſon, and eighth Objection) and therefore it can doe him good, for all the Commands of God are good; and it is but an heavy thing to bring up ſuch <hi>an evill report upon the good land</hi> of the Sacrament. This is the caſe: If the Sacrament can do an unregenerate member no good, then muſt ſuch be either bound neceſſarily to eat and drinke their owne damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe the Sacrament is not their duty.

               <p n="2">2 All Gods Ordinances within the Church are means of grace, whether firſt or ſecond, to be get or encreaſe it; as God hath declared, that hee wil <hi>meet</hi> with thoſe that <hi>wait</hi> on him in his <hi>wayes</hi> that <hi>come to his houſe.</hi> that <hi>ſeek his face,</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But actual receiving is a means for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of the ſoule to the conditions of the Covenant, or the termes of Chriſt, which a man may binde himſelfe to, before he hath performed, even, as Souldiers, ſervants, and all relations, do liſt,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:119920:123"/>agree, and oblige themſelves to their ſervices and duties, and ſtand to them after. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Here I thinke moſt Chriſtians know by their owne ſpirits, that they have very good reſolutions at ſome times (that make them fit for the preſent againſt all doubt) and yet finde often they come to nothing. Now what can more conduce (under the word) when we have ſome purpoſes of leaving ſinne, and aſſent to the termes of Chriſt, to beget a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of heart, and make them ſerious, then the obligation of this Ordinance? A penny in earneſt, bindes ſome men more, then twenty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
               <p n="9">9 That which can beget more degrees of the ſame grace, can beget the firſt grace, unleſſe theſe degrees are begotten ſome other way then that is; But all grace (firſt and ſecond) is begotten alike, as the Ordinances, propoſe the object, and then the Spirit of God by enlightning the minde, and a touch upon the will, brings the heart to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that object; which object is ſhewed forth in the Sacrament, as in the word; and it is a miſtake, to thinke that the ſecond grace (though it be within the promiſe which is ſealed,) is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by way of obſignation (for there is onely a fight to it this way conveyed) but it is wrought (I ſay) through the Spirit of God by the way of moral operation onely, as the firſt and ſecond grace both, are begotten in reading and hearing, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 The ſad conſequence of this Tenent, that the Sacrament belongs onely to the effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted is ſorely againſt it, and that both for the giver and receiver. For the Receiver, this will cut off every poor doubtful Chriſtian from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:119920:123"/>For
1. If I am bound to receive when I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and bound to forbear if I am unregenerate; then muſt I be perſwaded in my conſcience that I am regenerate, or elſe I cannot eate in faith; and he <hi>that eateth and doubteth is damned if he eat.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire this may be tenderly weighed.2. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count every one that comes, profeſſes himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and if any man be but doubtfull that he is not yet converted, he cannot come but he acts a lie, and is a publick hypocrite; which is a thing ſo hatefull to him, that rather then he would profeſſe of himſelfe, what he does not know, he would confeſſe his unworthineſſe, and never come there: and thus ſhall every humble tender Chriſtian only keep away, and the ſelfe-juſticiary-harden to death. For the giver, firſt, The caſe will be near the ſame, for the Sacrament cannot be adminiſtred according to rule, nor he act in faith, unleſſe both the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver is regenerate, and he aſſured of it (which he cannot be) if regeneration were a qualification commanded as neceſſary to receiving. Secondly, Men will be ready to think themſelves converted, when they are admitted, and the formal Chriſtian reſt in his eſtate, when he ſhould come hither to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it. Thirdly, The beſt Miniſter muſt fal infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſhort in the diſcharge of his tryall, were any at all required upon this ground. The Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves of Philoſophy, the firſt and lighter taſtes thereof inclines the mind towards Atheiſm; but a more fixed and deeper contemplation brings it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout again unto Religion: So doe I judge here, the firſt touches of Conſcience in the pious, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined them to a trial of others fitnes and unfitneſs to the Sacrament, but a more ſerious and digeſted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the iſſues of it, wil bring them about to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:119920:124"/>the Apoſtle, <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe,</hi> and the Miniſter onely doe his beſt for their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The confirming of a Chriſtians Faith in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, or his aſſent unto the truth of the Covenant in Jeſus Chriſt to him in particular, is a means of bringing up his heart to a ſpeciall Faith; for I am perſwaded here lies often the root of unregeneracy, that men doe not firmely beleeve the Goſpell; and where the holy Spirit works beleeving impreſſions, he ordinarily brings in the ſoul to him. But the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a means of confirming Faith, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in this act of aſſent, (which is common in its degree to the unregenerate with the regenerate) that if I will beleeve, repent, or accept of Chriſt, I ſhall be ſaved; <hi>Ergo.</hi> Unto this purpoſe Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> hath a clear paſſage, <hi>Primum verbo ſuo nos docet Deus, &amp; inſtituit Dominus; deinde Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis confirmat; poſtremo ſancti ſui ſpirit us lumine, mentibus noſtris illucet, &amp; aditum in sorda no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra, verbo &amp; Sacramentis, aperit.</hi> So that whereas <hi>Calvin</hi> with others, ordinarily cals the Sacraments confirming Ordinances; I ſhall take their meaning only thus, that they are not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to convert the Heathen to the Church, but to incorporate the members thereof, <hi>Who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the word, and confirmed by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the Spirit of God in the uſe of both</hi> (both Words and Sacraments, ſo he ſpeaks) <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a paſſage into their hearts,</hi> to wit, for their effectuall converſion, <hi>Calv. Inſt. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <hi>ſect.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The ſolemne application of the Covenant to a mans ſelfe according to his eſtate, to wit, of ſalvation through Chriſt if he will beleeve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:119920:124"/>and of judgement from Chriſt if he continues in his ſins, and does not turn effectually unto him, is the very onely way whereby the Spirit uſually worketh conviction, and ſincere converſion; but actual receiving of the Sacrament, is a ſolemn means of ſuch an application: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Apoſtle, <hi>Ro.</hi> 10.4. tels us Chriſt is the end of the Law; in this Law <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. it is written, <hi>Curſed be every one that continueth not in all things which are written therein to doe them:</hi> Unto this curſe <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>All the people were to ſay Amen.</hi> It is nor poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible all the people ſhould be guiltleſſe; yet this Amen is a particular application, ſo that the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction it ſelfe, as well as the precept, is to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly applyed, for a Schoolmaſter to Chriſt, who is in that reſpect ſaid to be the end thereof. Now then, muſt a Chriſtian that does not as he ſhould, unfainedly repent, but harbour his ſins in his heart, apply the Covenant in the right part, to wit, that judgement which is due for them, and is both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and ſealed, to make him turne ſincerely from them, unto the mercy that is together offered him, if he does. And while his heart melts, and hee humbles himſelfe before Chriſt as worthy thereof, he lies under the very ſtrokes of Gods Spirit, to drive him in effectually to him.</p>
               <p>When the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. bids us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves, leaſt we eate unworthily, and drink our damnation, he ſweetly addes, <hi>for if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.</hi> There are Scriptures I find, that will ſupport a Chriſtian in his duty, yet happily will not hold the diſputes of men, that go to take the comfort of them from us: In this caſe the pious ſoule is not to hearken to them, but to ſtrengthen it ſelfe in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:119920:125"/>upon God. There is a ſweet promiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore comes often in my mind with this Text, I will not ſay a promiſe to diſpute withal, but to reſt upon for our encouragement. It is in <hi>Zach.</hi> 10.12. <hi>I will poure out the ſpirit of grace and ſupplications, and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and they ſhall mourne.</hi> Poor ſoules! you have in the Sacrament, as in the Word, Jeſus Chriſt repreſented to you as pierced; you are to apply it, and ſay, Here Lord thou haſt promiſed to pour out the Spirit of grace on thoſe that look on thee for to mourn over the wounds which they have made in thee, by their ſins; Let the ſight of thy broken body, break my hard heart; Let the ſight of thy pierced ſides, pierce mine eyes; and of thy bleeding heart make my heart to bleed, in an unfained repentance, and converſion towards thee. <hi>Let this Word of the Lord be good unto me, which he hath ſpoken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no wonder there are ſo few Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted at the Sacrament, when we do not uſe it for converſion, when the Miniſters have no expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Chriſt, nor inſtruct their people for it. And if any of them ſhall have ſome good impreſſions wrought upon their hearts by this bleſſed Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; while they are taught it cannot convert them, they ſhal but diſtruſt the work to be ineffectual, and ſo derogate from the good Spirit, be injurious to their poor ſouls, and if poſſible, looſe, quench, and not improve it.</p>
               <p>For my part therefore I will exhort every one to a ſelf-examination, and if he does not find himſelf regenerate, but willing to go on in his ſins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Jeſus Chriſt, I will not gratifie him ſo far, to ſay he muſt ſtay away; as if he were now to lay by
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:119920:125"/>the thoughts of him; This were doctrine after the Fleſhes owne heart, but I judge rather, his duty ſtill lyes upon him for to come; He is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred of the death of Chriſt, unto which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute by his ſinnes; he is by his actual receiving, both to aſſure his ſoule of a juſt condemnation, unleſſe he repents, and to binde on his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience his certain duty of Faith and Converſion, if ever he be ſaved.</p>
               <p>And now whereas the Devil uſually doth beat off poor ſinners from acceptance of Chriſt, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting them with the ſtrictneſſe of his termes, as if they ſhould but encreaſe their hypocriſie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they could be immediately perfect; I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe thee if thou canſt not ſincerely leave all thy ſinnes at once, yet doe not give up thy ſoule quite as loſt, but rather; firſt bewailing and condemning thy ſelfe wherein thou faileſt, engage againſt ſome one corruption or other, and ſo wear them off, if thou canſt not otherwiſe, by little and little. Truly Chriſtians, it were ſome good uſe of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the blood of Chriſt may every time waſh away one ſtaine: It were much better ſure, then to trample on that blood, and reject it. I would have thee likewiſe, if thou canſt not at once bring up thy heart to that full obedience as thou oughteſt, humbling thy ſoule ſtill for thy infirmity, reſolve at leaſt this time upon one duty, and next upon another, and bee reforming according to thy ſtrength; It will be ſomething if a poore ſinner can but every Sacrament get one ſtep forward neerer God; for I am perſwaded wee may ſafely ſay, that ſuch a perſon, if he be not yet converted, is more in the may of effectual grace, he is neerer to the Kingdome of Heaven, (<hi>Mark.</hi> 12.34.) then
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:119920:126"/>before, and Chriſt is better pleaſed with him, to make ſome good uſe of his Ordinances, then wholly to neglect them, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Jon.</hi> 3.9.10.1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What if thou ſhouldeſt not yet have any ſaving grace, this will not ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſe thee from thy duty; Thou haſt, I hope, ſome kinde of faith, love, and thanks to give unto Chriſt, and why ſhouldeſt not thou offer to him that poore mite that thou haſt, and ſay, O my Saviour, Though I may not yet be permitted with <hi>John</hi> to lay my vile head in thy boſome, yet will I with <hi>Mary</hi> fall downe, and catch hold of the feet of my Lord; I will condemne my ſelfe, wait on thy Free-grace, and do my duty.</p>
               <p>The Scripture in ſome places tels us, we have no ſufficiency of our ſelves, <hi>Of him we have the will and the deed;</hi> yet in others, it layes the whole ſtreſſe on mans ſelfe, <hi>Why will you dye, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> &amp;c. The beſt reconciliation I thinke of ſuch Texts, will be by practiſe; A Chriſtian is to labour and ſet himſelfe to his duty, as if he could gain life by it, and yet is he wholly to depend upon the Free-grace of God in the doing, as that alone which can make it effectual. And with ſubmiſſion, I judge that all thoſe actings and tendencies of mens hearts towards Converſion, in the uſe of means, if they end in Converſion, ſhall be reckoned upon a regenerate account, as if they prove but abortions, they ſhall be reckoned upon a natural account, at the great day.</p>
               <p>There is indeed ſome diſtinction the Scripture ſeems to put between unregenerate men as to Gods worſhip, in ſuch places, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16, 16, 17. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106, 79. and 44. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall not venture hore upon any exact
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:119920:126"/>uſe of it, but onely beſeech my Readers, that as I have been tender, you ſhould not bring a guilt on your ſelves, by a neglect of your duty, you will not ſo ill requite my Labours, to bring a guilt on me, by any careleſſe, ſecure, preſumptuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it. I muſt profeſſe againſt you, I doe not teach you this, I doe not teach any to come, and come unworthily; but to come worthily, yet to come. I tell you, you muſt examine your ſelves, humble your ſelves, reſolve againſt your ſinnes, ſet upon duties, <hi>Come then, and let us reaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;</hi> If you thinke worthily of your ſelves, you ſtand on your own juſtification, look well to your condition, <hi>But if you will judge your ſelves, you ſhall not be judged.</hi>

               <p>We read of <hi>Eliſha</hi> when he had got the Mantle of <hi>Elijah,</hi> he ſmote with it on the waters, ſaying, <hi>Where is the Lord God of Elijah?</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt hath aſcended to his Father, and left us this Sacrament, as the Mantle, or Symbol of his Body, Come thou now, ſmite on the waters of thy heart with it, and ſay, <hi>Where is the Lord God of Jeſus?</hi> Where is the grace, life, power, vertue of his Ordinance, which thou, O Lord, canſt make effectual to us when thou pleaſeſt, for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as our confirmation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore now cloſe up this point with one preſident, from a neighbour Miniſter, a man godly, judicious, and truly worthy, whoſe teſtimony is without exception; and whereas Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is ready to cite me before the great Tribunal, I may appeale thither to thoſe many Saints in Heaven, together with this party, that will riſe up for me, and bee my witneſſes, by their own experience, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting power in this Ordinance.</p>

               <p>Unto this, all Mr. <hi>D.</hi> anſwers (p 176.) is, <hi>Mr.</hi> H. <hi>in two leaves takes ſome pains to ſmal purpoſe.

               <p>I muſt confeſſe there are here many difficulties, if we compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14 12. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.28. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.14. This one thing ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice me for an argument; The evening of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and morning of the fifteenth day of <hi>Niſan</hi> (as I judge) was the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of the Paſſeover; for the Scripture reckons the day from evening to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.5. and from the evening of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, to the evening of the twenty one, is juſt ſeven evenings and mornings, and ſo the feaſt compleat of ſeven Scripture dayes according to the computation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.15, 16, 18. and this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains <hi>Num.</hi> 28.16, 17. where the fourteenth day is called the Paſſeover, and the fifteenth the Feaſt of the Paſſeover, and yet the Paſſeover and feaſt, not diſtinguiſhed, as ſome think.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:119920:128"/>
               <p>Now then I argue, if this Supper of <hi>John</hi> was before the evening of the fourteenth of <hi>Niſan,</hi> then was it not when Chriſt inſtituted the Sacrament; for he inſtituted that queſtionleſſe at the Paſſeover; But this Supper was before that evening, <hi>Probo.</hi> The evening of the fourteenth day of <hi>Niſan,</hi> and the morning of the fifteenth (as appears) was the feaſt of the Paſſeover, (or the day of the feaſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>As for thoſe other reaſons Mr, <hi>D.</hi> repeates againſt <hi>Judas</hi> receiving, and are anſwered before, I count them only as ſo many cyphers joyned to a figure, which may ſerve indeed to advance the number while that figure ſtands, but when this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon once (which is the figure) is taken away, the reſt will come to ſigniſie nothing of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.

I ſhall hore then deſire Mr. <hi>D.</hi> to ſee and acknowledge this ſame abſurdity in himſelfe (who goes wholly on this ground) for if affirmative propoſitions are not excluſive (which is his meaning) then how can he ſtill argue and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on us, that becauſe the Apoſtle ſaies, let a man <hi>ſo eate,</hi> therefore a man muſt not eate, unleſſe <hi>ſo.</hi>2. If this be abſurd in Divinity and Logick, it may bee demanded, how then will Mr. <hi>D.</hi> make good, <hi>therefore another muſt examine me:</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:119920:129"/>I will tell you how hee may in Rhetorick, <hi>per Apoſiopeſin,</hi> for the Scripture ſayes nothing of it.</p>
               <p>For his ſimile of poyſon p. 179. 180. he tels us,
1, <hi>Whoſoever can, ought to hinder his brother from drinking poyſon. Anſw.</hi> There is no doubt of it.2. <hi>The Sacrament to ſome is poyſon, as one mans meat is anothers poyſon. Anſ.</hi> This inſtance may ſatisfie us, I muſt give a man his food, and ſo I give the Sacrament; if by his ill uſe of it, it turnes to poyſon, this is accidentall to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, and to me; I muſt doe my duty, as in the word 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16.But 3. <hi>He ſaies, he may know, and judge, when the Sacrament is poyſon to any. Anſ.</hi> This were ſinfull to ſay, but that he addes, <hi>by the effects and, conſequents,</hi> ſo that he muſt firſt belike, give them a little poyſon to try them. But I pray what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is here in the mean while? Becauſe <hi>he ſees ſome men after receiving worſe then formerly,</hi> therefore, he knows the Sacrament is poyſon, and before-hand (like a Phiſitian) wil not give it.4. <hi>The Sacrament may be applied before all, not to all; all may ſee, and be preſent, not eate, &amp;c. Anſ.</hi> This is but a kind of ſpice of ſecret Popery, with which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would ſweeten the bitterneſſe of his book, that yet will not goe down, he has ſtrewed it ſo thick. <hi>Chriſt ordained the Supper to be a taking matter, an eating matter, a remembring mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (ſaies Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> with Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi>) <hi>Contrary, our Maſſe-men make it a matter not of taking, but of gazing, peeping, I thank God I have ſeen my Maker to day, &amp;c.</hi> Book of Martyrs vol. 3. p. 3.</p>
               <p>For the Receivers part, I ſay there is a double
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:119920:129"/>duty; A principle, <hi>Do this,</hi> and an Acceſſory, <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe,</hi> both which, is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; A man muſt come, and he muſt come worthily, the caſe is the ſame, as in all Ordinances, there is the ſubſtance of a duty, and the manner of performance; If the manner be evil, it muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and the matter ſtill muſt be done. He has three Objections, page 181, 182, 183.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How aſſuredly doth Mr.</hi> H. <hi>make that the principle duty which is the carkaſſe and forme onely? Anſw.</hi> Methinks Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſhould not ſpeake ſo lightly of Chriſts owne words, <hi>Do this?</hi> who dares not know, <hi>Doe this,</hi> includes matter and manner, to wit, in faith, love, thankfulneſſe, as wee ought; and if this be not the principal duty, to which ſelf-examination is ſubſervient, let all judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Even as the Feaſt though it laſts but an hour, is the principal; &amp; the whole week of preparation, acceſſory to it. As for his words then that follow, they are but a pen full of inke ſpartled in my face, while his peeviſh ſpirit, <hi>like a troubled ſea, is ſtill caſting up mire and dirt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>True, He that is bound to come, is bound to come worthily, but he that is bound to come worthily, is not bound to come abſolutely. Anſw.</hi> I know not how he may ſtraine the word abſolutely, but I ſay, a Church-member is as abſolutely bound to come hither, as ſo pray, and heare; as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Let a man ſo eat,</hi> Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Take heed how you hear, ſo pray, and ſo give almes.</hi> But are they therefore ever the leſſe abſolute duties? There is no doubt but the manner, as well as the matter, comes under the ſame abſolute command; ſo that a man is bound, I ſay ſtill, to come, and come worthily, and both
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:119920:130"/>abſolutely, though not, <hi>Ad ſemper,</hi> to either. And therefore, whereas he askes, p. 178. <hi>Every man is to examine himſelfe, and ſo to eat, but where is it ſaid abſolutely. Let every man eat?</hi> It may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice him, that Chriſt ſayes expreſly, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to all preſent. Let every one drinke, <hi>Doe this, Drinke you all of it.</hi> But let me aske him again, Where doth the Scripture ſay any where, Let a man <hi>not eat,</hi> or <hi>not drinke?</hi> where doth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſo,</hi> ſignifie <hi>not?</hi> As for his inſtances then about Legal purifications, they are anſwered in their place; They may ſerve to be alluded to (if he will) for preſſing preparation, but ought not to be made any ground to omit duty; becauſe no <hi>legal uncleanneſſe</hi> could have excuſed a man from Gods ſervice, but that it had an expreſſe law for it; which if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce here, we ſhall yeeld to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Sinful unpreparedneſſe will not exouſe a man from guilt, but it will excuſe him from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving: Anſw.</hi> I judge this muſt be taken very warily, ſo far onely as a man may in Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence diſpenſe with affirmative precepts for his ſoules better advantage: <hi>Provided his abſtinence ſerves to humble him, and put him upon greater eare to prepare for the next Sacrament,</hi> (as hee cautions well over the leaf) and if it will not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, this may ſilence himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Page 184. He comes to my three Queries; The firſt is, Whether the very receiving be a ſin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring damnation in him that is unworthy? and here I carefully diſtinguiſh between the very receiving, which is a mans duty, and the unworthineſſe, which makes the ſinne onely: This unworthineſſe is either <hi>in the perſon,</hi> which will condemne him, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholeſſe for his ſtaying away, and therefore I judge
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119920:130"/>hee ſhould rather come, and condemne it. Or in <hi>the Act;</hi> herein is the matter, which is good, and the manner, which is amiſſe. Now the ſayling in the manner of a duty (I muſt ſtill inculcate) doth not abrogate the matter. If Mr. <hi>D.</hi> can keep an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man from the obliquity in the manner, and yet let him doe the matter, I ſhall like him; but he may not cauſe him to neglect that which is his duty in the ſubſtance, to avoid evill in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; Our diſobedience is total in not doing, but onely partial in doing it otherwiſe then we ought.</p>
               <p>Indeed Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſayes here, theſe cannot bee diſtinguiſhed, <hi>There is no ſinful act, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally you may abſtract ſinfulneſſe from it, but really you cannot, when it comes to bee acted. Anſw.</hi> Let him remember, if hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſtinguiſh Receiving, and unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, then can he not diſtinguiſh Hearing, and unworthy Hearing; Praying, and unworthy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; And if he cannot really (and not notionally only) ſever theſe, how can he make them means of grace? Can ſinne be a means of grace? Can that which is a cauſe of death, be a means of life? If hee ſay, it may be an accidental occaſion; it is true, but it muſt be intentionally a means with him; ſeeing he tells us, <hi>A man may hear (and pray) unworthily</hi> (page 186.) (there is a ſinful act, which cannot, hee ſayes, be abſtracted really in the duty from the ſinne) <hi>yet be converted by it,</hi> (there it is a means of grace, and inſtituted for it.) I thinke this muſt be a plaine conviction upon Mr. <hi>D.</hi>
1 Hearing and Praying, are means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. 2 To heare and pray unworthily is a ſinne. 3 Yet muſt a man heare and pray nevertheleſſe. <pb n="248" facs="tcp:119920:131"/>4 Sinne cannot be a means of grace. 5 A man muſt not doe evill for any good effect. Now if you can abſtract really in no ſinful act, the ſinfumeſſe from it, when it comes to be acted;
1 Then muſt ſinne be a means of converſion.2 Then muſt it be our duty to ſinne.3 Then muſt we contradict St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſay, a man may doe evill that good may come of it. As for what he farther addes, <hi>A man is not bound to receive till he be Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally worthy, but is prohibited in</hi> ſtatu quo; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to ſhew me that prohibition, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> eleventh Commandement, that makes all his ſtrength being without the ſupport of any Text, to become but as a <hi>bowing wall, and tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering fence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My ſecond Query is, whether receiving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily is other wayes damnable, then hearing and praying unworthily, and if it be not, why ſhould not we receive ſtill, as pray and heare; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>It is otherwiſe damnable,</hi>
1 <hi>Becauſe not a univerſal duty,</hi> (where he brings in Infants the eighteenth time)2 <hi>Not converting. Anſ.</hi>
1 This is untrue, for as to every intelligent member it is an univerſal duty, and a means of converſion.2 It is vaine, and groſſely inconſequent; for, There are ſome duties belong onely to men in ſuch and ſuch relations; Is the neglect hereof, ever the leſſe damnable, becauſe they are not univerſal? Again, A natural man cannot convert himſelfe by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral works; are his ſinnes therefore ever the leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? As the precept onely is that which makes an action to bee good, ſo it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion alone (not any thing elſe) makes it damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>My third Query is, Whether an unregenerate
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:119920:131"/>man muſt never come to the Sacrament? Mr. <hi>D.</hi> holds, he muſt never, becauſe in will not convert him; I hold the caſe is ſtill the ſame with the word and prayer, which though they become the ſavour of death unto ſome, yet muſt not the duty bee neglected, and the precept plucked up by the roots. I ſhall therefore here joyne iſſue with him.</p>
               <p>If there be any weight in the ground upon which he goes, that an unregerate man muſt not receive, becauſe it will not convert him, then an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man muſt not doe that which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting; If this be not good, his argument will be <hi>ex puris particularibus,</hi> and cannot be good: If it be good, then muſt Mr. <hi>D.</hi> prove to me that ſinging of Pſalmes, Alms-deeds, obedience to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, love to our neighbour, and all the duties of the ten Commandements are inſtituted of God as means of converſion, or otherwiſe an unregenerate man muſt not doe them. If he ſay, they are means of converſion, I will diſtinguiſh hereof, either they proceed from a preparatory worke of grace through Gods Spirit upon the heart, and ſo I think indeed in a due ſenſe they are converting; Or they proceed from a bare principle of reaſon, or natural conſcience, and ſo they cannot be converting, for nature alone (the Scripture teaches us) can never begot grace. Now then, I aske him whether ſuch bare moral actions (which yet as to the matter are good workes, and every mans duty) doe ceaſe therefore to be duties, and ought not to be done, becauſe not converting? If they doe not, then is M. <hi>Drakes</hi> foundation, but as a banck of ſand, which the more he ſtands upon, failes him, and ſinkes away.</p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:119920:132"/>
               <p>There are two things in Gods Ordinances, an homage that is due to him, and a benefit accruing to us, as they are means of his grace. Now let me demand of any mortal, how dare he bereave God of his homage (though outward onely) becauſe he cannot reap his owne benefit? What if there were no benefit to man, muſt not the will of God ſtand? Againe, Is it not the duty of every one within the Church to remember Chriſt, ſhew forth his death, and be thankful, if it were onely that he is brought into a Church-ſtate, and relation to God, which <hi>Paul</hi> accounts ſo high a priviledge to the <hi>Jewes?</hi> And is not the Ordinance appointed to this end? how then can any totally neglect it without ſin? and muſt he ſin, to avoid ſin? muſt he do evill, that he may not doe evil? how can this be? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is true, there are other ends beſides this, which an unregenerate man cannot doe; but muſt this end it ſelfe therefore be abrogate? The Lord Jeſus was not capable of remiſſion of ſins, muſt he therefore not be baptized? It is enough, that there was an homage herein, or duty due unto God from him as man, though he could receive no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by it. So long then as this homage ſtands good, and here are ſome ends every intelligent member is capable of; how can mans eating, or not eating his damnation, ſtand in ballance with the will of God? The will of God muſt ſtand againſt all conſequence.</p>
               <p>Indeed Mr. <hi>D.</hi> Page 186. ſtill urges, <hi>He that heares unworthily may be converted, not ſo, hee that receives unworthily, at that time.</hi> But I ſay, where did Mr. <hi>D.</hi> learne, a man muſt hear the word (or pray) though he hears unworthily upon this ground, becauſe it is a means of converſion, as
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:119920:132"/>he ſtill pleads p. 98. p. 116.185. &amp;c. The truth is, this ground alone could not ſtand, for hearing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily is certainly a ſin (which he ſaies further can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be really ſevered from the act) and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaies, it is a dangerous thing to hold ſuch a tenent that men may ſin, <hi>or do evill</hi> (as to hear unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is) <hi>that any good</hi> (as converſion is) <hi>may come of it.</hi> But the ground then indeed, why a man muſt pray, hear, receive, though he does it unworthily, is becauſe God has commanded it, and we muſt not omit our duty, to avoid ſin; becauſe <hi>wee muſt not do evill</hi> (which that omiſſion is) <hi>that good</hi> (which the avoiding ſin is) <hi>may come of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Page Ib. He diſtinguiſhes between <hi>Abſtainers and Refuſers. Anſ.</hi> This diſtinction cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied here, becauſe a man cannot <hi>alwaies</hi> forbear an Ordinance, though he may <hi>ſometimes,</hi> but his omiſſion makes him a Refuſer and Neglecter; and my queſtion is, Whether an unregenerate man muſt never receive, for fear of earing his damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p>Page 187. Whereas I ſay, what is ſealed is the ſame, he tels us, <hi>This is an apparent falſity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſalvation and damnation is the ſame. Anſ.</hi> It is an apparent truth, for I doe expreſſely ſay, <hi>That which is ſealed,</hi> is the Covenant, and that is the ſame I hope, though our eſtate alters, as to the threatnings and promiſes in it. And this paſſage, I hope, ſhall doe much good (which therefore I have recited before) when Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> looſe and malicious aſperſions ſhall doe him no good. <hi>He that beareth falſe witneſſe againſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is a maule, and a Sword and a ſharp Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>

               <p>Page 188. <hi>What releif can the Sacrament bring to a doubtfull ſoule that hath no grace?</hi>
1. <hi>It cannot convert him.</hi>2. <hi>It cannot confirm him. Anſw.</hi> This is amiſſe, It can confirm him in his common, generall grace; and the exerciſe thereof, is the way, wherein we are to waite for effectuall grace. So then, it can convert him, and confirm him; and convert him, becauſe confirm him.</p>
               <p>Pag. Ib. <hi>The Receiver ſeales as neceſſarily to the condition</hi> (to wit of the Covenant) in Eſſe, <hi>or</hi> de preſenti; <hi>as</hi> in fieri, <hi>or</hi> de futuro. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This cannot be. For
1. Children ſeale to the ſame in Baptiſme.2. The whole body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> engaged to the ſame, when they entred Covenant, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 29.) and did but what they were to do, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do, and yet had not all of them a ſaving Faith, for many of them were deſtroyed (<hi>Heb:</hi> 4.1, 2,) for their unbeleefe. Indeed where there is an engagement required, there ought to be alſo a ſincere reſolution to perform what we engaged. There is the matter of the engagement, and the manner of the engagement; the right manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this ſerious and ſincere reſolution; If wee faile in the manner it is to be amended, and the matter ſtill to be done. It is not a Cannot what I will, but a Will not what I Can, and a Doe not what I will and can, ſhall condemn a man at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Page 189. <hi>By actuall receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a man profeſſes he receives Chriſt, ſignified and offered to him in particular, and therefore if he does not act Faith at the ſame inſtant, he plaies the Hypocrite and mocks God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I think this ſcruple as it is more cloſely urged by others, ſinks deepeſt in this buſineſſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:119920:133"/>of any, and therefore requires the larger conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then, There is a reall undiſſembled Faith (whether you call it general, hiſtorical, or viſible) that fals ſhort of Saving, Juſtifying Faith, that makes a man truely a Diſciple, or Profeſſor, though not a true Diſciple, or ſincere Profeſſor; in Covenant, though not effectually in Covenant: Now that common Faith, as it makes a man a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, it makes him partaker of the Ordinances, and his waiting thereupon, or meeting at the Word and Sacraments, is his very profeſſion ſignified; and his badge that he is one of the viſible Church; ſo that you muſt either ſay that every unregenerate man muſt leave off his profeſſion, and become no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, or the ſcruple is removed; for the truth is, that Faith he hath in the doctrine of Chriſt, ſo far as it is undiſſembled, and makes him a Chriſtian in oppoſition to all other Religions, will bear him up in the profeſſion, and make it his duty for to come, which in the manner ought to be done, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not left undone.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The caſe is the ſame in all Ordinances, while a Chriſtian comes to the Word, that is a ſignified profeſſion that he will obey the mind of God when it is revealed: now unleſſe hee heartily reſolves to practice what he hears, it is a like mocking God, and playing the hypocrite (if I may uſe his words) <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50.16, 17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 43.2, 5, 20. Likewiſe in Prayer, there is a vertuall engagement of us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor the grace we pray for; Nay, herein is the moſt expreſſe hypocriſie, for how can an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdome of grace come,</hi> when he doth not ſincerely deſire grace (which yet he ought to pray, and ſincerely deſire too) if he
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:119920:134"/>did truly deſire it, he were regenerate; for <hi>a deſire of true grace</hi> (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſayes) <hi>is true grace.</hi> Yet doe I think Mr. <hi>D.</hi> doth not exclude any of his unregenerate Members from the Word and Prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This argument then is ſtrong to enforce men to the manner, when they doe the matter; but not to leave off the matter, becauſe they faile in the manner. It is of force to preſſe men to bring up their hearts and lives to their engagements, but not to forbear thoſe engagements they are bound to, as Profeſſors.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Though a profeſſor be unregenerate, he does 0 truly beleeve Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God, and the alone Saviour of the World, in oppoſition to all other Religions, and thereof this is a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and that ſuffices to the Sacraments <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely conſidered,</hi> though not <hi>complexly,</hi> as to the entire benefits of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="5">5 So far as a man is in Chriſt, or a member of his Church, Chriſt is given to him, and received of him, with a true diſtinction of priviledge from the world.</p>
               <p n="6">6 He engages himſelfe (or is engaged) hereby to ſubmit to the termes of Jeſus Chriſt, as he is bound to do, which if he do not perform, it is the iſſue makes it a lie, and him an hypocrite (<hi>Pſa.</hi> 78.35. with 37.) but the obligation it ſelfe (and that ſincerely) is his duty.</p>
               <p n="7">7 There is the nature and ſubſtance of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and the divers uſes to be made of it; The very nature and ſubſtance conſiſts in a Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſt; An unregenerate man is capable of this ſubſtance, and ſo it becomes his duty, which cannot bee made voyd by the mal-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:119920:134"/>for no conſequence can annihilate Gods Precept. Neither doth my incapacity of ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the ends and uſes of an Ordinance (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) exempt me from thoſe I can; for then neither could children be capable of Baptiſme, not Chriſt of Circumciſion.</p>
               <p n="8">8 As the Miniſter doth tender and apply Jeſus Chriſt conditionally to all according to the termes of the Covenant, ſo may he receive him, to wit, as looking for ſalvation from him upon performance of the condition, and condemnation if he continues in unbeliefe without repentance (as the caſe in penal obligations) this being the means both to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, and fright him to it. And then,</p>
               <p n="9">9 The full and ſafeſt anſwer to this, will be by a ſerious practiſe; Let us examine our ſelves, and humbling our ſoules in the ſight of our unworthineſs, acknowledge our deſerts, and apply the due ſenſe of our juſt condemnation according to our preſent eſtate, together with the offer of mercy, upon our amendment, and this takes off the hypocriſie; for if my actual receiving be a Lye (to wit, as it is a viſible profeſſion) it muſt be ſo, either before God, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men; It is not a Lye before men, for I hold it a means of converſion, and profeſs not my ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted already, but come onely as a Church-member; and It is not a Lye before God (I mean ſo far as any unregenerate mans ſervice can bee without it) for I condemne my ſelfe, and apply that part of the Covenant which is due to mee (as I ought with the offer of grace) to bring mee home to him.</p>
               <p>Page 190. <hi>I eaſily grant, aſſurance is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely requiſite, as a means to receiving.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:119920:135"/>Anſw.</hi> Upon this true conceſſion, I argue againſt him in the maine; If it be neceſſarily pre-required that a man be regenerate before he receives, then muſt aſſurance be abſolutely requiſite as a means; But ſeeing aſſurance is not neceſſary as a means, therefore it is not neceſſarily pre-required that a man be regenerate, and this becomes a means of converſion. The former I prove: That which a man cannot be perſwaded in his conſcience is lawful to doe, it is ſin if it bee done, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23. But a man that holds it abſolutely unlawful for an unregenerate man to eat, and is not certaine, that he himſelfe is regenerate, cannot be aſſured in his conſcience that he ought to eat. <hi>And hee that doubteth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not with faith, for whatſoever is not of faith is ſinne.</hi> This is the miſery is brought upon us, while men deny the Sacrament to be a means of converſion.</p>
               <p>Page <hi>Ibid.</hi> and 191. Whereas I preſs upon the Receiver to reſolve againſt every knowne ſin for the preſent, and to accept of Chriſt, which is his duty, as well as to come. He excepts at me as not ſpeaking conſonantly to my ſelf, and the nature of faith.</p>
               <p>For the former, I do beleeve, we know ſo little of the nature of ſpirits, our own ſouls &amp; actings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo infinitly leſs the workings of Gods Spirit, that I dare not confine my ſelfe herein. I doe not doubt but there may be many good reſolutions, and ſome ſupernatural motions on the hearts of men which prove abortions, when the like deſires che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the uſe of the means, by Gods grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come effectual. It is therefore my Doctrine, that a Chriſtian ſhould ſtill endeavour to blow up
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:119920:135"/>every ſpark, deſire, or good motion he finds in him. We do not know how the ſeeds (or firſt impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) of grace differ in any, and diſcover them onely, by the rooting and continuance; If com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace differ from ſpecial only gradually (which for ought we know may bee the truth) then we have a certain promiſe, that in the uſe and exerciſe, thoſe degrees ſhall be increaſed, which will make it ſaving; <hi>Habenti dabitur.</hi> If it d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ffers ſpecifically, (which thoſe terms of the immortall ſeed, the new birth, regeneration &amp;c. do incline me to beleeve,) yet have we a <hi>Peradventure,</hi> in the uſe of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which we have not otherwiſe; And I conceive as the act of man brings in the wind and water in their Mils, and makes uſe of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall motions, to doe their work, and ſerve their occaſions: So does the holy Spirit make uſe of Gods voluntary actings, in his waiting on the means, for the effecting of his ſpeciall worke of grace in him, which is, as it were, acquired by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet ſo, <hi>as we can do nothing of our ſelves, It is the free gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the latter, I doe admire he ſhould ſay, <hi>Mr.</hi> H. <hi>profeſſeth he knowes no other conſtituting parts of ſaving faith, then an Hiſtoricall aſſent and good purpoſe,</hi> when I ſpeak hereof onely as what ſuffices to the Sacrament, not to juſtification; And whereas upon this he <hi>wiſhes Mr.</hi> H. <hi>would ſtudy fundamentalls better, before he come to ſuperſtructures;</hi> I ſhall deſire him, ſeeing he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges our diſpute to be but about a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure, that he would not be ſo hot, and froward that another differs from him. And as for my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies about this point of the nature of Faith, I ſhall ſubmit my ſelfe to give him this ſmall account of them.</p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:119920:136"/>
               <p>Faith is an aſſent to a teſtimony, and ſo it differs from Knowledge, Experience &amp;c. That teſtimony, is either of Man, and then it is an humane; or of God, and then it is a divine Faith. Divine Faith then is an aſſent to divine Revelation, or the Word of God, and it is either general or ſpecial; General. Faith is this aſſent, without effectual application; Special is this aſſent with it; and this aſſent with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is Saving Faith. Now this Special Faith <hi>in the habit,</hi> hath two acts (according to its object in the word) the one, whereby it is carryed out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the precepts and threats for obedience; or the other, as it is carryed out upon the promiſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the great Promiſe of ſalvation through Chriſt, and this is the act we ſay juſtifies, whether <hi>in ſenſu proprio,</hi> or <hi>in ſenſu correlativo,</hi> in reſpect of its object, the point ſeems decided by thoſe two Texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. where to bee juſtified <hi>by Faith in Chriſts blood,</hi> is to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>by his blood.</hi> Yet doe I think that thoſe men that doe, as it were, compound theſe two acts into one, and call it acceptance of Chriſt as Lord and Saviour, and ſo ſay it juſtifies as the Covenant-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſpeak piouſly, ſolidly, and ſafely, as to theſe times.</p>
               <p>To cloſe up this eighth Objection. Though it is certain, a Speciall Faith is required to every ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving duty; yet whereas the duty (at leaſt, as a task, ſervice, tribute) muſt ſtill be don; I will adviſe every Receiver to look mainly into this one thing, that there be not upon him the unworthineſſe of an evill conſcience, which I account not in reference to his life paſt, though he has been an ignorant, obſtinate, and grievous ſinner, ſo long as for his life to come, he now reſolves to go on no more in any of his known,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:119920:136"/>wilfull ſins againſt Conſcience, but to leave them, and if his heart upon examination can truly tell him this, though he be unregenerate, and this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but legall, and preparatory, yet ſeeing he can heartily for the preſent engage himſelfe to the terms of Chriſt, as there is nothing in his Conſcience can be oppoſed againſt his coming: So, I am intirely perſwaded (without the leaſt doubt as to ſuch a one) that this Ordinance is a moſt fit means (ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the Word) to make his good purpoſes ſerious, for his effectuall converſion. And as for thoſe harſh termes, and opinions of others, that a man if he be unregenerate, does but mock God, murder Chriſt, drink his poyſon, and cate neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily his damnation; It would even pitty a man to the heart to ſee how they make the <hi>holy Table</hi> of the Lord to become <hi>a ſnare,</hi> a very rack, terror, and torture to many conſciences, while our grand Enemy makes uſe thereof to defraud our ſoules of then due ſuſtentation by it. The fear of guilt and damnation, may be applyed for the preſſing men to preparation, but not to keep any from his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>A perſon famous for wit, being condemned, had his life promiſed him, on condition he could make a fat Lamb become leane within ſuch a time, and yet allow him his ordinary meat; This he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes; prepares two grates, in the one he puts the Lamb, and gives him the food required, in the other he puts a Wolfe, and gives him no meat. As the Wolfe growes hungry hee baites at the Lamb, with his head and pawes raving at him; the poore Lamb in the ſight of ſo much terror though he cate his meat, pines ſuddenly away, and becomes as lean as if he had been quite famiſhed
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:119920:137"/>for want of it. I am afraid it fares thus with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the tender Lambes of Jeſus Chriſt, who whiles they doubt of their regeneration, and men ſet damnation to rave at, and bark them away if unregenerate, not being ſenſible of the grates that protect them, they feed at the bleſſed Table of the Lord with ſo much fear and doubtfulneſſe, that their ſpiritual meat hardly does them good, or their poor ſoules thrive by it. <hi>It is even as when an hungry man dreameth, and behold he eateth, but he awaketh, and his ſoule is empty; or as when a thirſty man dreameth, and he drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but he awaketh, and behold hee is faint.</hi>

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:119920:138"/>Chriſtians, while he involves every ſoule under the guilt of participation with the Receiver, in his ſin of unworthy receiving, If they doo not their beſt to hinder him from receiving, which yet is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a duty (where ſtill lyes this ſad fallacy) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſeoundum quid,</hi> in reference to the parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment as the end, and excommunication as the means, whereby a man being caſt out of Chriſtian Communion in generall, is conſequently debarred the Sacrament: and otherwiſe to keep him from it, is amiſſe, as going upon this falſe ground, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſſe to the Sacrament is the formall cauſe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; and I fear ſinful, becauſe it is <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> our duty to exhort (and in our places to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare) all our fellow-members both to come, and come worthily to it. To clear this, ſuppoſe a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man deſerves to be excommunicate, and I do not complain of him, he comes and receives in faith; Now if I muſt partake of a mans receiving unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, when I ſhould endeavor his excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and do not, then muſt I partake in this mans receiving worthily; and ſo my not endeavouring their excommunication ſhall be good in the one, and ſin in the other.

                  </gap>, but this is one only continued guilt on me, that I do not my duty in admoniſhing and telling the Church of him, ſuppoſing the cale ſo, that it is my duty.</p>
               <p>If it were my duty ſimply or abſolutely to keep away the unworthy from the Sacrament, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, no man then could keep himſelfe from guilt;) it would be my duty alſo to keep them from the Word and Prayer. For
1. There is the ſame
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:119920:138"/>morall pollution in the one, as the other, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.2. The ſin is as abſtractible in the one as the other.3. The one is our duty as well as the other, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Mr. <hi>D.</hi> can give us any text that forbids it. And here indeed will come the iſſue of all. When Chriſt ſays, <hi>Baptize all Nations,</hi> thoſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Infants, muſt ſhew Texts for it. When the Scripture ſays, all <hi>the Congregation, the whole people, every man</hi> was to eat the Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.

Thoſe that will except the unregenerate (which is likely the greater part) out of theſe, doe affirm a limitation, and muſt prove it. <hi>When you come together,</hi> ver. 33. does to mee plainly include, both a ſuppoſall they would come together, and an allowance that they might. Their manner of coming is reproved, but their coming together, and that to eate, is what they ought.</p>
               <p>There may be here one caſe to be ſatisfied; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have not admoniſhed my Brother, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of him, is not the neglect of my duty a ſin? and how then ſhall I come to the Sacrament with this ſin on my Conſcience, but it ſhall be defiled to me? I Anſwer, if thy Conſcience tels there it is a ſin (for there is ſome prudence to go in to it) thou art to repent of it, by reſolving to take the next op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to perform thy duty thou haſt omitted; and upon this reſolution of thine (as in the like neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects) there is no doubt but thou mayſt come ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 2. If thou haſt neglected one duty, I dare not ſay that omiſſion can excuſe thee from doing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother duty, the Apoſtle commands us <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. to lay apart all naughtineſſe and ſo to receive the word:

               <p>As for what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> objects here, I have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied at once already. I ſhall onely leave two notes;
1 Whereas Mr. <hi>D.</hi> accounts my opinion (that excommunication referres to Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in geueral) to be 1 Falſe;2 Cruel, I am perſwaded he will be of another minde when hee comes to underſtand mee better, how I take this, that is Relatively, wherein I thinke, I am neer the truth. And hereupon it will follow that every ſlight occaſion muſt not ſerve for Church-cenſure, but ſuch notorious crimes as will bring a defamation on the Church, and our Chriſtian profeſſion, if ſuffered; whereas if we allow any cenſure leſſe then caſting out of the Church, it is no wonder, if bare ignorance, or any ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be held enough for it; By which means, our Church cenſures are like to become ordinary, and ſoon contemned, which ſhould indeed bee ever adminiſtred for this very reſpect, with the greateſt dreadfulneſſe, rarity, and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Separation from wicked men (as to their perſons) may be conſidered <hi>ſimplicitèr,</hi> or <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid,</hi> as it is conſidered ſimply (or abſolutely) it is not a duty, for a man may go into the company of evill perſons upon his neceſſary buſineſſe, and as Chriſt himſelfe did, to admoniſh, and do them good. But as it is taken <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively, in reſpect of ſuch or ſuch an end, ſo is it our duty. Now that end, either reſpects our ſelves, or them; That which reſpects our ſelves, is to avoid their ſinnes, or not to partake thereof, by acting with them, infection, connivance, or the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:119920:140"/>like; And This reſpect does alwayes binde, ſo that in ſuch caſe as we muſt needs partake of their ſins, we are undoubtedly to avoid them: That which reſpects them, is to bring them to repentance, by ſhaming them, &amp;c. Hereupon it will follow, that if any man goes to avoid his brother in Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, unleſſe it be to this end, his ſeparation is evill, the reaſon being plaine, becauſe as I am bound to avoid the leaſt partaking of anothers ſinnes ſo am I bound to the greateſt partaking with him in duty, and though I muſt ſeparate from him in civil familiarity (I mean common, and unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) where I have my liberty (and not elſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 13, 14.) unleſſe it be to exhort, and edifie him; Yet may I not, in ſacred ſociety, and the ſervice of God (which is both his and my duty) unleſſe he be excommunicate. I pray note this, Separation, I ſay, is either from civill ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety alone, or from Sacred, and Civill both; In the firſt, I am to withdraw from every one that walketh diſorderly, (yet with prudence) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of him; But the ſecond is proper to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſure, before which, my withdrawing from him in publick duty, is not like to be any means of bringing the man to repentance, but rather to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him; and therefore, to ſpeak freely, I fear it is but a likely ſinne, to withdraw from others at the Sacrament, before Excommunication.</p>
               <p>P. 204. He comes to my wiſhes, which he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to approve, &amp; engage me to him before he parts, with two paſſages; The firſt is Page 205. where he tells me, he hath made me an object of frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal correption, and hopes, I am in a fair way to be mended by his admonition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Had the man been longer a Divine, or a
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:119920:140"/>little more modeſt in the ſpirit of meeknes, &amp; words of ſobriety, he could have managed his cauſe, with me, I think (ſo far as I know of my own ſpirit) that I am ſo conſelous of my owne weakneſs, and afraid to offend others, that I ſhould have been more ready to a ſubmiſſion, then diſſertation, could it have ſtood with any face of truth and ingenuity: but when I ſee how his whole book is carried with ſuch a high conceit of himſelfe, and intereſt, ſo much contempt of me, bitterneſs of language, paſſion, and incontinency, truly, it is a great argument to me (and inward ſupport againſt his opinion) that the Lord doth not approve it, or at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to ſucceed it. If it had been the minde of Chriſt, it is more likely he would have humbled his heart, and ſuited him a ſpirit fit to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that minde to us; But now hath his temper betrayed his cauſe, now are his Arguments little beſides prejudice; now are his inſtructions but briars and thorns, with which he goes to teach me, only as <hi>Gideon taught the men of Succoth.</hi> Now are theſe admonitions which ſhould come from him as a brother, but the bitter inſultations of an adverſary; which muſt make me anſwer him in the words of <hi>Micha,</hi> 7.8, 9. <hi>Rejoyce not againſt me, Oh mine enemy, when I fall I ſhall riſe, when I ſit in darkneſſe, the Lord ſhall be a light unto me. I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him, untill he plead my cauſe for me, he will bring me forth to the light, and I ſhall behold his righteouſneſſe.</hi>

               <p>The ſecond is, Page 206. <hi>How juſtly may be at laſt be looked at as a Weed by our great Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, who will cheriſh Weeds, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Methinks it were enough for Mr. <hi>D.</hi> to have
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:119920:141"/>paſſed a ſuſpenſion on me in the beginning of his Book, he needed not have proſecuted it to the end, and even to the laſt judgement. It is not for him to take the Tribunal, and condemn me for a Weed at the great day. I deſire God, that this mans raſhneſs may teach me to conſider his righteous Judgement, that I may <hi>ſanctifie him in my heart, and make him my fear, and my dread;</hi> ſo ſhall I reap the benefit of his cenſure, without the guilt of it. I muſt humbly acknowledge, if the Lord ſhould deal with mee according to my deſerts, he might indeed juſtly look at me as a Weed, and condemne me for ever; <hi>But enter not into judgement with thy ſervant, O Lord,</hi> but take occaſion by this mans judgement to forgive me, and him; for thou ſeeſt how ſome mens piety out-runs their charity, and their over-eager zeale, like <hi>Moſes,</hi> breaks the Tables: And though he would have me ſuſpended from the favour of thy people, doe not thou ſuſpend him, or me from a fellowſhip in thy mercies, and while he is ready to ſhut up the boſome of the Church againſt me, as if it could no: hold me, and him, let me be aſſured that <hi>Abrahamt</hi> boſome ſtands wide enough open to receive both me, and my oppoſer.</p>
               <p>I could have heartily wiſhed Mr. <hi>D.</hi> had ſo carried his buſineſs, that I might rather have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced his judgement, and yeelded to his piety, then be forced to ſhew him his weakneſs, which yet may ſerve to abate his imperiouſneſs, and ſome wearineſs in the Reader. For my part, I ſhall prepare my ſelfe to expect from him nothing but the dregs of his former bitterneſſe, and that many godly men will ſpeak evill of my Booke, though they ſhall receive a relaxation, and ſupport by it;
